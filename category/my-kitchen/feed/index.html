<p> You can minimalize your kitchen in several ways. Among them, you can spend a whole day, or if you have little time you can use these recommendations which will take you not more than 15 minutes a day to accomplish. Below, we will show you how to minimalize your kitchen step by step. </p>



<h3> <strong>Step 1: Start in The Pantry</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg" alt="pantry" class="wp-image-1176" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://www.playtalklearn.com/">playtalklearn.com</a>  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Start by reviewing the due dates and throw away everything that you will not be able to use before the due dates. Then review what has not expired and keep only what you’ll really use within their shelf life. It’s time to go! Throw them out! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 2: Refrigerator and Freezer</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg" alt="organizing my fridge" class="wp-image-1059" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Repeat the steps of the pantry for the refrigerator and freezer. Do not forget to clean every space that you are going to minimize. There is something about seeing a clean space, which makes you think about what you are going to put there. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 3: Plastic Containers</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg" alt="Containers" class="wp-image-1183" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcrecycles/4074783459">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>  By minimizing your containers, just like crockery. It is important to take into account how many are in the house and how many are used. This will help you not to get rid of anything that you really need. Besides that, it will give you the opportunity to keep those that you really use and inspire you. For some reason, it is one of the elements that seem to multiply by themselves. </p>



<p> Once you know what you use and how many of it you need, it&#8217;s time to get rid of the rest. There is no need to have thousands of useless containers in your space. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 4: Pots and Pans</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg" alt="Pots and Pans" class="wp-image-1178" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/r4andred/511125951/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Once again, think about the preparations you make to know what utensils you actually use. You will see that you hardly really need that collection of pots of all sizes. By now you already know what to do with the ones you don’t need. </p>



<h3><strong> Step 5: Molds for Oven</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg" alt="Molds" class="wp-image-1163" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> With the preparations you usually make in mind; be honest with yourself and keep those molds that you will truly use. </p>



<p> Do not kid yourself thinking that maybe later you might need some of these.<br> The reality is that if you have not used it until now (or only once) there is not much chance that you will need it. As it is something sporadic it is better to borrow it and save yourself having it saved all your life just for that one time. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 6: Crockery</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg" alt="crockery" class="wp-image-1177" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> How many are in the house? This is the fundamental question to minimize your tableware. You do not need 15 dishes if there are only 3 in the house for example. </p>



<p> Maybe you wonder what I do when I receive visitors? Well, simple. Make sure to have a package of cardboard plates and cutlery in case of having visitors. Not only will it save you space, but you will not have to wash off more when someone comes. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 7: Cutlery and Ladles</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg" alt="Cutlery and Ladles" class="wp-image-1180" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Like crockery, you do not need more than the number of people in the house.<br> Why do you have a drawer full of forks, spoons, and knives when in reality you only use a couple of each? </p>



<h3><strong>Step 8: Home Appliances</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg" alt="Home Appliances" class="wp-image-1181" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg 725w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></figure></div>



<p> A secret that can help you keep your kitchen clear is &#8211; try to use your utensils in more ways than one. And this applies to each of the previous points as well. </p>



<p> By minimizing the number of appliances you have, you not only clear your kitchen and simplify your life, but you have the opportunity to sell what you do not use and make some money in the attempt. </p>



<p> Keep what you really use, do not keep things thinking of a day you will use it. Get rid of kitchenware tools you do not need after separating the things you really use! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 9: Others</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg" alt="kitchenware" class="wp-image-1182" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97226447@N00/7412770556/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>

Some kitchenware tools like a chopping board, drainer, and potatoes peeler, among others can come handy on a good day.<br> You do not have to love cooking, but it should not be a torture either. The fewer utensils you have, the less time you spend washing, organizing and cleaning. You will see that it becomes more bearable when everything handy.

<p> This is one major area that will have a profound impact on how your kitchen looks. Failure to use the storage area appropriately can ruin the good look of your kitchen. Your kitchen might appear spacious, but if things are not stored in their right places you might feel suffocated.</p>



<p> There are numerous storage ideas that you can utilize to give your kitchen a simplified yet comprehensive look. Some of these hacks are succinctly discussed in the following lines.</p>

<p> <strong>Pull-Out Pantries</strong><br> If you’ve been to a kitchen with pull-out pantries, then you know these storage spaces are indeed worth having in any modern kitchen. The exciting aspect of this storage space is that when you pull out the pantry drawer, you will gain access to multiple shelves. This means that you have more space within a single unit. The idea can be incorporated into your cabinets.</p>



<p> <strong>Pull-Out Spice Racks</strong><br> The pull-out spice racks as similar to pull-out pantries. Their designs are different since they are meant to hold boxes and jars.</p>



<p> <strong>Shelves Next to Your Kitchen Windows</strong><br> There is a great frame effect that you get when you incorporate floating shelves into your kitchen. Contingent on your window size, you can design varying sizes of your storage components. These shelves should be used as storage spaces for dishes and other cookware that you use frequently.</p>



<p><strong> Mug Racks</strong><br> There is something interesting about the mugs and cups we use for breakfast.<br> Most people have a personal attachment to their cups or mugs. It is for this reason that you will find folks using the same cup throughout the year. You should embrace the idea of hanging your favorite mugs and cups on hooks. A key issue to remember is that you should not make your kitchen crowded with these hangings. As such, limit the number of cups that you choose to hang.</p>



<p> <strong>Woven Storage Baskets</strong><br> There are certain spaces in your kitchen that will be unoccupied most of the time. They are called the kitchen islands. This space can be occupied by woven storage baskets. Doing this will help you create additional space that can hold items that don’t belong to the kitchen, such as your car keys or your smartphone.</p>



<p> There are many ways of creatively creating storage space around your kitchen. Your chosen technique should help in creating space and not crowding up the place. Therefore, you should settle for the best solutions which suit you.</p>



<p> Essentially, the importance of understanding the kitchen zones is that it aids in knowing what goes where in your kitchen. You cannot maintain an organized kitchen if you don’t know how its layout looks like. Also, this information is handy when one is looking to remodel their kitchen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-Zones.jpg" alt="Kitchen Zones" class="wp-image-1194"/></figure></div>



<p>For decades, most people had embraced the idea of arranging their kitchen using the “kitchen-triangle” layout. The layout had a particular position for the sink, refrigerator, and stove. They were organized in a way that a person wouldn’t need to take several steps before accessing any of the areas. There are some kitchens that still use this layout to this day. However, with the evolution of the kitchen space, this layout no longer applies to large kitchens.</p>



<p> When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.<br> Common zones that you should expect in any kitchen include the cooking zone, cleaning zone, and the storage zone. Understanding the purpose of these zones guarantees that you organize your kitchen in the best way possible. This chapter takes a closer look at how these zones should look.</p>



<h2> The Prep Zone</h2>



<p> Just as the name suggests, this is the area where you prepare yourself to cook.<br> There are several activities that you can do including washing, slicing, peeling, chopping, and draining right before the actual cooking begins. When baking, there are many activities that will take place before the cooking begins. It is vital that you move from one zone to the other systematically when cooking. Usually, these zones will overlap.</p>



<p> It’s important to have sufficient space to conduct all the activities that take place in the prep zone. For that reason, you should consider uncluttering the kitchen counters here. Also, you should utilize the storage spaces in the prep zone wisely to ensure that you minimize overlapping from one end to the other. Use the storage strategy where you store items based on usage.</p>



<p> The prep zone will have a few cabinets for you to store what you will use during meal preparation. Make sure that your organization creates room for accessibility. Don’t store unwanted things in these cabinets because other cabinets are full. Everything in your kitchen has its home. If not, then consider storing in your junk drawer or donating.</p>



<h2> The Cooking Zone</h2>



<p> The cooking zone will feature a number of things around your kitchen including the stove cooktop and several appliances that you use most often.<br> The warming drawer or a microwave will be found here. Also, keep in mind that breakfast is a common meal to most people, and a toaster or coffee maker could also be found in the cooking zone. Stocking the cooking zone should be done appropriately. This means that the drawers and cabinets in this section should be used for cooking purposes. You should store baking pans, utensils, pots, cookie sheets, etc. in these storage spaces.</p>



<h2>The Cleaning Zone</h2>



<p> Depending on the size of your kitchen, there are several cleaning zones that you will have in your kitchen. Regardless, this area is usually in close proximity with the sink. The trash bins are also part of this zone because they are the sections that help in keeping your kitchen free from dirt. The cooking process will begin and end here. Before preparing any meal, you will have to wash the ingredients. Once you are done eating, it’s in the cleaning zone where you will wash the dirty dishes.</p>



<p> The cleaning area should not be far from the cooking zone or the prep zone.<br> In fact, larger kitchens can have several sinks next to the prep area for convenience purposes. It should also be noted that it can be a great idea to position the washing area close to a window. This provides you with natural ambience to enjoy while cleaning the dishes. Ideally, this can be a great place to cool off your mind and enjoy a healthy conversation with anyone giving you company as you clean.</p>



<h2> The Storage Zone</h2>



<p> This is one major area that will have a profound impact on how your kitchen looks. Failure to use the storage area appropriately can ruin the good look of your kitchen. Your kitchen might appear spacious, but if things are not stored in their right places you might feel suffocated.</p>



<p> There are numerous storage ideas that you can utilize to give your kitchen a simplified yet comprehensive look. Some of these hacks are succinctly discussed in the following lines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bare-kitchen.jpg" alt="my kitchen" class="wp-image-1089"/></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;The kitchen is the most dynamic area of the House, it is the place that converges more smells, tastes, textures and elements that draw attention to the user and his guests.&#8221;</p>



<p> According to the paragraphs above, you can see that it is very important to have a kitchen in the House; much better if it is a small one. Below, we&#8217;ll see why it is vital to have it in the house, especially if it is small.</p>



<h3> 1 &#8211; It is a meeting point</h3>



<p> The kitchen is a meeting point for family gatherings and, in addition, space where you can explore your passion for food and its preparation.</p>



<p> Many tasks of the day are hung in the fridge; the important dates are hanging there too. In the fridge also are placed notes or diets, and calendar… Let&#8217;s say that the fridge is our daily task monitor. The kitchen is a meeting point; it is the area where everyone can find the other. If you have something important to say to someone you&#8217;ll do it in the kitchen.</p>



<p> If you imagine your House as a large company, consider your kitchen as the office of the Chef. It is a place where the most important decisions are made by talking and conversing. It is also a place where the most important thing of the day and of the organism is prepared: Food</p>



<h3> 2 &#8211; Create harmony in the family</h3>



<p> It is understood that in the kitchen, appeals to all the senses are created &#8211; topics of conversation that probably do not arise in other areas of the House.</p>



<p> Though the residence is spacious, the kitchen is an integrated area of greater use (family living) and to the rooms. Everything works in an integrated manner and is oriented towards the garden, allowing communication between different areas. The kitchen is designed as a social space where harmony is created in the family.</p>



<p> A kitchen should be one in which the design does not interfere with the sensory experience that produces what is prepared in it. Its ultimate goal is to convert an everyday and necessary task in a pleasant and social experience.</p>



<h2>Some Reasons Why You Must Have A Kitchen In The House</h2>



<h4> Reason #1: More space and more happiness</h4>



<p> Let’s imagine that you want to put a kitchen but you do not have much space. The built-in kitchen is the best option. The same sentence says it and there is not much more to explain: you can have all the elements of the kitchen lined up on a single wall, i.e. incorporated as if they were a single body. The first and obvious advantage that comes to mind is the one that has been mentioned: space.</p>



<p> To have everything together, small departments with many places, even to put a beautiful breakfast room somewhere in the traditional method, which had been occupied. Some designers go beyond and hide the kitchen behind doors, so the spectrum of the atmosphere changes completely and can be used as a second living room in case you organize, for example, a party.</p>



<h4> Reason #2: More comfort than we think</h4>



<p> Let’s take, for example, the case of the built-in kitchen. There are those who think that the kitchen can generate problems. On the contrary, today built-in kitchens come in all sizes and can be adapted to any type of wall. The built-in kitchen can be much more generous than you ever imagined. With the addition of the cupboard in the same space as the oven and the counter you save a huge amount of space and time in case you have to organize utensils.</p>



<h2>Benefits of A Minimal Kitchen</h2>



<p> It is always good to debug until you only have the utensils you really use and some extra things (but not too many) because doing so, there are more benefits for you.</p>



<h4>Cleaning is easy</h4>



<p> The surfaces are almost always free, so simply pass a cloth to remove the dust or any stain. So, when you have a few dishes and cutlery, it is practically impossible to leave them unwashed. In case you want to eat again, just wash the dishes you used before, simply because there are no more (except those that you have for visitors, but those are kept separately).</p>



<h4>Cooking is very comfortable</h4>



<p> There is nothing like cooking over a clear and clean area. By having few things, cooking becomes simpler and enjoyable; unhindered and with plenty of room to maneuver.</p>



<h4>Everything is reachable</h4>



<p> The drawers and the cupboards are arranged in such a way that it is very easy to find anything that you need. The utensils and ingredients are always handy.</p>



<h4>Less Tupperware = Less rotten food</h4>



<p> When you have few Tupperware, it becomes mandatory to review what are being used. If you want to store something and you do not have any free Tupperware, it is likely that they are busy keeping old food. In this way, you force yourself to rotate them and avoid filling the refrigerator with inedible stuffs.</p>



<h4>Less expired things</h4>



<p> You know exactly what you have in the refrigerator and in the cupboard.<br> You’ll never have to buy too much food but constantly checking what you have left. This helps you to have more order and avoid accumulating old food.</p>



<h4>You want to cook healthy</h4>



<p> In a saturated and dirty kitchen you do not want to prepare anything healthy, on the contrary, what you prefer is to eat anything quick and easy. On the other hand, a clean and tidy kitchen motivates you to prepare fresh and healthy foods.</p>



<h4>Inspire to have it beautiful</h4>



<p> Order calls to order and beauty calls to beauty. Love your kitchen very much and make sure to have it always clean and tidy. Never leave dirty things lying around carelessly, simply because you like to see your kitchen neat and beautiful. This translates into peace of mind and a happy home and by extension, a healthy life.</p>



<p> It is important to remember that everyone should have their kitchen (and their house) as it works best for them. This means, with more or less things according to the style and taste of each one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchen-To-Share.jpg" alt="kitchen To Share" class="wp-image-1086"/></figure></div>



<p> Living together with colleagues in the apartment can leave you with some hobbies such as not being able to stand the silence of an empty place, but also valuable teachings. You have to be very supportive of the customs, manners, and laziness of people.</p>



<p> If you are about to share your kitchen, you should try to make peace between you and your roommates. Therefore, not only will you have to maintain that relationship with them, but you will also need to take care of and maintain your minimalist style. In this chapter, you will find tips on how to make that possible.</p>



<h3>Tip #1: Divide the refrigerator and you will win</h3>



<p> When different people live in a house, the tastes are different. Maybe the refrigerator is always full of beers, or other things that perhaps you don’t really like. In case there is only one refrigerator, the best thing you can do is that each person has their own shelf. Also, it is better not to make everyone buy stuffs the same day. Doing so, the refrigerator and the pantry get stuck. You have to coordinate the days of purchase of each one.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Place your food in the fridge strategically</h3>



<p> The food that you leave near the refrigerator door is the one that finishes first. It is better to put it behind, but be careful that it will not be forgotten or it will be spoiled.</p>



<h3>Tip #3: Reach an agreement to consume only one type of milk</h3>



<p> Unless one is lactose intolerant, another vegan and one more prefers chocolate. It is better to have only one type of milk for everyone. Products like salt, sugar, and oil also work and less mess is made.</p>



<h3>Tip #4: Do not be afraid to throw out the outdated, even if it&#8217;s alien</h3>



<p> If you see a yogurt that is going to expire, it is best that you eat it, notify the owner and replenish it. If you detect that something has already broken down, throw it away. You do not even have to notice it; they forgot it for a reason.</p>



<h3>Tip #5: Wash that dirty rate from days ago; it does not matter if it&#8217;s from another</h3>



<p> Unwashed dishes create a mess and can be an important point of conflict. It is better everyone washes his dishes and there is no major problem. If you find something small like a glass or a spoon, nothing happens if you wash it. But if a person tends to leave what he uses without washing, it is best to talk to him about that.</p>



<h3>Tip #6: Hire a cleaning professional and divide the rate</h3>



<p> Using these services once or twice a week is the best and the payment is divided among all. In truth that makes things much simpler.</p>



<h3>Tip #7: Take turns to take out the organic trash</h3>



<p> There are many people who do not know how to separate trash and it is very important to have this skill. The best thing is to take the trash religiously on Saturday or another day. And, you have to make turns because nobody wants to take care of the organic trash. This is because it smells the worst and drips.</p>



<h4>How To Move Your Kitchen In The Fastest And Most Save Way?</h4>



<p> If you live in a rental and you are young, then changes are usually part of your life: moving to new countries, new jobs, and therefore, new floors are treaded on every day. So this is surely neither the first nor the last time.</p>



<p> Therefore, you can develop techniques or strategies to make this process less tedious, much more practical, quick and organized and make sure that you only take the essentials home to your kitchen.</p>



<h4>What Comes Before The Move?</h4>



<p> As you know a long time ago that you are going to move to your new apartment, you can begin a strong and complete declutter process.<br> It takes a couple of days trying to plan where your things will be located in<br> the new apartment. This is useful for two reasons.</p>



<ol><li>The first is that it allows you to plan now the flow of the move (what to take first and what to take later).</li><li>The second is that it helps you to practice the famous minimalist question: do I have a space to store it? If there is no space for something, then that something should not reach the new apartment.</li></ol>



<h4>Techniques For Moving Faster And Safer Way</h4>



<p> <strong>Technique #1: Make a list of your future needs</strong><br> Think about the needs that you will have in your new home: do you go to a smaller or larger house? In the city or in a town? Do you have exit to the outside or terrace? Is the weather warmer or cooler? Wet or dry? All this will help you to understand what kind of things you will need to take with you and which ones definitely should be left behind. Despite being a minimalist style, a kitchen consists of a number of different individual modules, countertops, accessories, and equipment.</p>



<p> For example, is the furniture in your old kitchen kept in good condition?<br> Calculate the costs of dismantling, transport, accessories (in most cases you have to change the countertops), assembly and possible installation work and wiring. In short, value the costs and risks of maintaining your old kitchen.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #2: Prepare this area in three parts: recycling, reuse and moving</strong><br> Especially clear this area to deposit objects that you neither need nor use for anything (recycling), those that you do not need but still have utility (reuse) and those that you need and you will take to your next home (move).</p>



<p><strong> Technique #3: Divide your objects by categories</strong><br> If you start to select objects without a specific order you will get tired and discouraged very quickly. To make this process more organized you can use a checklist (mentioned in technique #1).</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #4: Begin to select</strong><br> Select the items in the first category of the checklist in each of the three parts of the kitchen area (recycling, reuse, and removal). Then go to the next category, and the next, and the next to finish with the checklist. This is the first filter for a kitchen only with what is necessary and what you most want, so do not be sorry. Allow only items with these characteristics into your life and everything will be to your advantage: a minimalist kitchen from the beginning, less weight to carry and move, more space and order, etc.</p>



<p> We recommend making a list of pending and schedule pre-move tasks:</p>



<ul><li> Sort belongings</li><li> Organize what you will take.</li><li> Take recycling to the collection center.</li><li> Save what you are going to keep.</li><li> What should be left before the day of moving.</li><li> What to do on the day of the move</li></ul>



<p><strong>Technique #5: Recycle</strong><br> Gather all the objects in the recycling area and remember the infallible trick for your minimalist cleaning. Recycle your discarded belongings as soon as possible.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #6: Reuse</strong><br> Donate, give away or resell everything that is in good condition and may be needed by others. If you think there is something that can be useful to the next tenant (open cleaning products, brooms or mops, kitchen utensils), give it to him and write him a note so he knows he can use them.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #7: Start packing</strong><br> Pack by categories leaving out only what is necessary for the last days. Do not buy new boxes to keep. Sure, what you have at home already serves you (suitcases, large reusable shopping bags, plastic storage boxes, baskets, etc.).<br> Finally, do not forget to label the boxes so you will know where you have everything and it will be easier to find a specific item when you arrive at your new home.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #8: Organize in boxes what you are going to keep</strong><br> Prepare to save what you will keep and separate in boxes by priorities:</p>



<ul><li> <strong>High</strong>: What is very necessary and functional</li><li> <strong>Media</strong>: What you would like to unpack soon but which is not necessary.</li><li> <strong>Low</strong>: What is decorative</li></ul>



<p>This will allow you to unpack more peacefully and without haste.</p>



<p> <strong>Advice: Systematize the move</strong></p>



<ul><li> To make everything easier, differentiate the boxes.</li><li> Write down the space they belong to.</li><li> Assign a number by priority (1 is the highest priority).</li></ul>



<p> This way, once you arrive at your new home, you can take the boxes to their respective spaces and open only those that has the number 1 marked. Little by little you can open the others.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #9: And the day arrives! Organize your move</strong><br> If you have a moving service, congratulations! And if not, you have to load.<br> If you have an elevator, congratulations again! And if not, you have to load up the stairs (if any). To make everything more bearable, ask for help from friends and family and reward them with a good meal (after all who wouldn’t settle for a good meal?). In addition, this will help you to establish an organization system: first the largest furniture, then the small ones together with boxes and suitcases, and finally small objects to fill in the gaps.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #10: When everything is ready to go, clean</strong><br> When the van is full and the house empty, take advantage and do a good general cleaning. Nobody likes to find a dirty house, and although it sounds a bit weird. It will be good for you to spend some time alone with the house, say goodbye and think about this new stage in which you are embarking.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #11: When you get to your new home, do not unpack anything</strong><br> Yes, we know that this is the opposite of what is always said: it is important to unpack and place as soon as possible to get rid of it and continue with our lives. But, maybe not. Unpack little by little only what you need and miss and leave the rest untouched for up to a month. What you did not get out after that time, you probably do not need it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> We&#8217;re going to give you a list of what you need and another list of what you do not need for your kitchen. Surely a few kitchenware are more forgotten than remembered. There will be some that you did not know you had and others that are there and it&#8217;s time that they leave space in your kitchen.</p>



<p> The idea is to make your life easier, that at the time of cooking everything is accessible and handy, and not buried in thousands of kitchenware . </p>



<p style="color:#ffffff;font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-background has-text-align-center has-vivid-green-cyan-background-color"><strong>Kitchenware You DON’T Really Need</strong></p>



<p> As kitchens that have inherited dozens of culinary artifacts and have suffered a certain addiction to the compulsive purchase of kitchenware, we assure you that you can live without them altogether.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>16. Knives of 10 Different Sizes</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/knives.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1158" width="563" height="366"/></figure></div>



<p> We all use one knife or two on a regular basis either for their shape or grip without using the other knives.&nbsp;The idea&nbsp;is to keep a few knives, and&nbsp;replace them with another whenever needed instead of collecting a multi-kit do we don&#8217;t need. With three that cut well, you’re good.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>15. Pasta Machine </strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pasta-Machine.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1160" width="563" height="375"/></figure></div>



<p> I&#8217;ve had a pasta machine for about one year, and it&#8217;s never even been out of the box.&nbsp;You will use it once every 100 years (unless you are Italian).</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 14. Lemon Squeezer</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lemon-squeezer.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1454" width="582" height="438" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lemon-squeezer.jpg 776w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lemon-squeezer-300x226.jpg 300w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lemon-squeezer-768x578.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></figure></div>



<p> Truly, the hand-held&nbsp;lemon squeezer&nbsp;is perfect to use and to store. It takes a little space and can do the work. live the whole life or the simple fork.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 13. Specific Pitchers or Peelers of Fruits</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1453" width="452" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg 602w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></figure></div>



<p>These items don&#8217;t deserve to be found in the kitchen to be used seasonally or for rare occasions. You will not remember that you have them when you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>12. Over 18 Molds for Cupcakes or Muffins</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1452" width="563" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></figure></div>



<p> We don&#8217;t have to collect all shapes of molds, we need just one or two beautiful shapes because cupcakes or muffins is what matters to us at the end. You have not put a cake shop.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 11. Wok</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Wok.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1164" width="563" height="319"/></figure></div>



<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need it to prepare satisfying oriental dishes. Unless you want to learn Chinese cooking, give it to the family that needs it or throw it out the window.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>10. Ice Cream Machine</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ice-Cream-Machine.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1165" width="563" height="373"/><figcaption>yourbestdigs.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It&#8217;s not worth the investment if you do not regularly make homemade ice cream. It is very little minimalist to have one.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 9. A Coffee Grinder or Spice Grinder</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1456" width="473" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg 630w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure></div>



<p>So, unless you use the grinder on a daily basis, it is best to simply buy quality pre-ground spices in small quantities so that they stay fresh and ready for your best dishes anytime you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>8. Cloths and Deteriorated Mittens</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Deteriorated-Mittens.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1167" width="563" height="321"/></figure></div>



<p>Usually at the bottom in the drawer accumulate the oldest rags, with some broken or impossible to remove. If you pull the ones that are on the top, it&#8217;s time to dig up the bottom ones and throw them away. Take advantage and check the mittens: if they are burned, say goodbye.<br> &#8220;It&#8217;s better to have 5 cloths in conditions that dry well than two dozen historic clothes,&#8221; says Gallay.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. As we saw in the previous chapter, the maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. The maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. i.e., what is essential is to have few things but each one performs its function perfectly.</p>



<p> For this reason, we will see a unique kitchen set up ideas to design your minimalist kitchen to create space.</p>



<h4>Idea #1: Everything in its place</h4>



<p> In the minimalist style, each item occupies a certain position that is defined by its functionality. In a style that less is more, simplicity is the key to its appeal.</p>



<h4>Idea #2: Attention to details</h4>



<p> The minimalist aesthetic can be present in any detail and if not, look at this spectacular staircase in the image below. Its simplicity, lighting, and design leaves no space for doubt. It is a perfect minimalist example.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/staircase.jpg" alt="staircase" class="wp-image-1077"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #3: Kitchen modern minimalist vintage</h4>



<p> For most modern interior or minimalist you can decant lacquered furniture that has a glossy or Matt finish. You can combine this color with accessories in aluminum or steel finishes, resulting to a modern outlook.</p>



<p> The walls can also be plain white, because you may have a smooth or tile wall. On the ceiling is also white is a good choice although it should be avoided in the floor. For these, it is best to use white but with touches of gray or sand colors.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-modern-minimalist-vintage.jpg" alt="Kitchen modern minimalist vintage" class="wp-image-1078"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #4: Ingenious solution</h4>



<p> When it comes to minimizing the presence of furniture and various appliances, relying on multifunctional elements can be a perfect solution. A piece of furniture acts as a bookstore, support for the television and improvised dividing wall of the entrance. What more could you want?</p>



<h4>Idea #5: Set of contrasts</h4>



<p> Not everything in minimalism should be clear white. Although the background color is important, you can combine it with grey or black resulting in spaces full of pure class and elegance.</p>



<h4>Idea #6: Kitchen in L</h4>



<p> Regardless of the actual size of your kitchen, if you adopt a minimalist style, this will help you to manage that space and make it look even broader. If you also like L design, you will earn meters for the circulation within it.</p>



<h4>Idea #7: materials</h4>



<p> Far from what it may seem, the minimalist style has nothing of aseptic or cold. Indeed, the interiors that are committed to this trend often introduce materials that provide warmth, such as the wood.</p>



<h4>Idea #8: Functional kitchen</h4>



<p> The details are great allies of the minimalist style. Why? The answer is simple. It’s a trend of little prone to recharging spaces, the existence of nuances is essential to create spaces full of qualities. In this case, incorporate one of these details as a counter, a practical bar for a functional space and style.</p>



<h4>Idea #9: Colonize the walls</h4>



<p> An alternative to the incorporation of the furnishings is that you can take advantage of the possibilities offered by the walls of your home. Place shelves do not have reasons to be overloaded. This allows you to embrace the minimalist style.</p>



<p>Idea #10: High ceilings</p>



<p> The high ceilings and loft-style homes are ideal for decorating with minimalist style scenarios. The amplitude at the height of this type of construction is a delight in creating unique spaces that is beautiful to behold.</p>



<h4>Idea #11: Save space in the Hall</h4>



<p> Often we tend to waste Hall space but it is a very valuable and useful meters. You can use the space for a series of cabinets which, though unnoticed, will give you great service.</p>



<h4>Idea #12: Mileage counters</h4>



<p> Counters are increasingly becoming quite common in kitchen designs. Not only in minimal spaces but also in any style. These type of elements are particularly useful not only in functionality but also for its marked aesthetic component.</p>



<h4>Idea #13: All-in-one</h4>



<p> Even if you don&#8217;t have space problems, minimalism is a style ideal to solve the home décor. This kitchen does not sacrifice a single centimeter by incorporating the necessary furniture, simplicity is the key to its appeal. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-All-in-one.jpg" alt="Kitchen All-in-one" class="wp-image-1079"/></figure></div>



<p> Anyway, remember that any space in your home is susceptible to succumb to the minimalist style and kitchen full of charm. All you have to do is just to visualize and decorate! </p>



<h2><strong>Now, How Should Your Minimalist Kitchen Be?</strong></h2>



<p> In the kitchen, it is common to accumulate accessories and decorations, some more useful than others. However, through minimalism, the tendency now is to achieve functional and sober kitchen environment that gives the sensation of order and harmony. Below, we are going to outline some characteristics that you can consider for your minimalist kitchen.</p>



<h4>Feature #1: Utility and practicality</h4>



<p> One of the first characteristics of a minimalist kitchen is the functionality. All kitchens must have an area of work where to cut, chop, whip and clean to make the task more efficient. This is why keeping a clear countertop is the first step to follow.</p>



<h4>Feature #2: Covered and stored appliances</h4>



<p> Some appliances that are not used on a daily basis such as grinder or Blender must be stored inside a cupboard so they are not in sight. The same goes with utensils and cutlery, which must be saved, but in an accessible place, for practical use of them when it comes to cooking and eating.</p>



<h4>Feature #3: Housekeeping</h4>



<p> Cleaning after every meal is essential for the provision of a neat and harmonious appearance. This detail will not only allow you to have a more minimalist space but also present you and your family comfort in your home.</p>



<h4>Feature #4: uncluttered space (for small spaces)</h4>



<p> To get the feeling of harmony and order it is important to have uncluttered spaces, no objects in the middle, especially if you do not have a large space. In addition, you must opt for simple geometries of straight lines in countertops, Islands, and cupboards.</p>



<h4>Feature #5: The colors of minimalism</h4>



<p> White is the color par excellence of the minimalism that gives an excellent result. In chairs, high or worktops of granite you can look for contrast and create harmony in the space. For example, you can combine white with grey and black. Also, the white floor and utensils in this tone, are the best choice to give light and beautiful ambience to the room.</p>



<p> Avoid colors like yellow, Orange and Brown.</p>



<h4>Feature #6: The cupboard</h4>



<p> The cupboards should be large and of practical design to keep all the utensils and cutlery neatly in place. It is common to finish with a shiny lacquer and straight lines on the doors, without any adornment and in neutral tones, mainly white.</p>



<h4>Feature #7: Appliances and furniture</h4>



<p> For the sink, the oven and the refrigerator, stainless steel is the best option, and the ceramic hob can be black on a white countertop.</p>



<p> The islands are a constant of this style with white chairs without backrest or with a black metal backrest to contrast.</p>



<h2>Some Tricks For Your Minimalist Kitchen</h2>



<h4>Trick #1: Kitchen islands</h4>



<p> If we talk about things that are fashionable for kitchens, you must have that clear: the Islands. We cannot define exactly the key to its success. But, the truth is that people who test it often become unrepentant.</p>



<ul><li> Islands better distribute the space in the kitchen.</li><li> They serve as a separator between the kitchen and dining room.</li><li> They allow you to move through them in one way more simple.</li><li> The Islands can be defined spaces, superior, where the countertop provides you a great area of work, and the bottom, perfect storage space to store dishes and other kitchen utensils.</li></ul>



<h4>Trick # 2: The order</h4>



<p> If there is something that attracts people to minimalism, it is precisely the sense of order that it gives to the kitchen. In the minimalist kitchen, there should be an almost total absence of accessories and furniture without handles.</p>



<h4>Trick # 3: Lighting</h4>



<p> The lights integrated into the furniture are a great success and if you decide to put them in your kitchen you will surely love the result. It facilitates the search for kitchen tools and also illuminates the rest of the room with charm and elegance.</p>



<p> With regard to lighting, it is very important in minimalist kitchens. A good combination of colors favor the lighting of the space. Strengthen the entrance of external light and think well about the distribution of the furniture so that they do not hinder its entrance. The cupboards with transparent doors for the tableware are perfect the most of spaces. Lighting should be white and modern light.</p>

<p><em>You don&#8217;t get anything clean without getting something else dirty. Cecil Baxter</em></p>



<h2>Sanitize the Baby Highchairs &amp; Booster Seats</h2>



<p> If you have a dishwasher, you can place the tray directly in the washer but make sure the washing cycle can reach a minimum of 16o° Fahrenheit.</p>



<p> You can also use dishwashing liquid and warm water to clean the entire chair. Use a wet wipe, a swab dipped in mouthwash that contains alcohol, and length of dental floss to clean the gunk from all of the nooks and crannies.</p>



<p> Every few days, wipe the chair with hydrogen peroxide which is a natural disinfectant that will kill the germs but won’t leave a residue behind. Do a deep cleaning weekly.</p>



<h2> Clean the Table &amp; Chairs</h2>



<p> If your table is wood, use a wood cleaner (see the recipe). Clean and polish the dining room table, chairs, and other articles of furniture. Be sure to check underneath the seats. You might need to use a whisk brook to remove some spider webs. You can also use dishwashing liquid and warm water to clean the entire chair.</p>



<h2> Gently Clean the Chandelier</h2>



<p> If you have a simple pattern; just dust the fixture and light bulbs with an inexpensive paintbrush. It will make the room brighter, and you won’t see any webs when it isn’t Halloween. If you have one of the types with all of the pretty glass bangles, use this method:</p>



<p> It is best to turn the circuit breaker off in the room where the fixture is located. If it is not possible, be sure to cover the switch plate to ensure the light won’t be turned on while you’re cleaning.</p>



<p> Place a blanket or tarp under the chandelier before you begin to catch the dust and (hopefully) break the fall if you drop a fragile piece of the glass.</p>



<p> Use a solution of 3 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar, and mix into a spray bottle. Spray a lint-free cloth with the solution and wipe down the spindle and arms of the chandelier. Use a dry lint-free cloth to buff it dry.</p>



<p> Clean the prisms using a vinegar/water solution sprayed on a cloth. Wear a pair of white/cotton gloves, so you don’t leave any smudges. You can purchase the gloves at a thrift shop for a minimal fee or online.</p>



<p> Tip: As you are cleaning the chandelier, be sure to lay out the prisms in a pattern, so you understand which way to place them back on the frame.</p>



<p> Remove all items from the cabinet and clean it. Use some of the wood cleaner to refresh the surface, naturally.</p>



<p> Take just five minutes to do a quick run in the china cabinet. You might be surprised what you end up with in your box of questionable items. Quickly, consider items you can easily part with and place them into a keep—toss— donate stack. Don’t be tempted to put it in the attic! Save the heirloom pieces and consider consigning, donating, or gifting the items.</p>



<p> It depends on how much silver you have, whether you clean it for now or wait until you have spare time in your schedule.</p>



<h2>Clean the Curtains</h2>



<p> Vacuum the curtains using the upholstery attachment. A quick once over should do the trick to remove most of the dust. If they look clean after the vacuum, you can use a lint roller later if a touchup is needed.</p>



<p> You have several options for thorough cleaning. You can use the delicate cycle on your washing machine or hand-wash the curtains. It will depend on the sturdiness, quality, as well as the material of the fabric. Check the labels before you proceed.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg" alt="kitchen-cleaning" class="wp-image-855" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> If you have a toddler and you think your kitchen is clean, all you need to do is turn around a few times, and your baby has probably found a way to find a new distraction causing another messy cleanup.</p>



<p> Let’s take a look at the kitchen cleaning methods and clean from the countertops to the kitchen floor.</p>



<h2> The Kitchen Sink:</h2>



<p> It’s time to tackle the kitchen sink. Just because you wash out the sink daily after you do a load of dishes, doesn’t mean it is clean. Water spots, rust, soap scum, and food stains can build up if you don’t stay ahead of them.</p>



<p> <strong>Porcelain Sinks:</strong> If you have a porcelain sink, you can make it gleam with this process:</p>



<ul><li>Line the sink with paper towels.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Soak them with bleach.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Let them soak for 30 minutes, and discard them.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Rinse the sink with hot running water.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Note</strong>: Don’t use bleach on colored porcelain because it will fade. Instead, use vinegar, baking soda, or a mild detergent (and a bit of elbow grease).</p>



<p> Now that you have the sink clean, you can protect it from scratches and stains by installing a plastic mat on the bottom of the sink. The mat will protect the shiny sink from lingering acidic foods/liquids such as salad dressing, vinegar, and fruit.</p>



<p><strong> The Garbage Disposal</strong>: If you smell something that seems rancid, it could be the garbage disposal needs some cleaning also. Simply, grind a few lemons in the unit to make it fresh and clean. Repeat the process every few weeks. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the drain for several hours before running the disposal. For a deeper clean, use this method for the garbage disposal drain:<br> What You Need:</p>



<p> ● White Vinegar (1 Cup)<br> ● Baking Soda (.5 cup)<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>The mixture will fizz (remember pop rocks candy from the 1970s) with a popping noise.</li><li>Wait a few minutes.</li><li>Pour boiling water down the drain.</li><li>Fill the drain with 2 cups of ice.</li><li>Pour one cup of salt in the drain over the ice cubes (rock salt or sea salt is a good choice if you have it).</li><li>Turn the cold-water faucet to the on position.</li><li>Turn on the disposal unit.</li><li>Run the disposal until the ice is gone.</li><li>The grime and debris should be loosened. Cut a lime or lemon in half and let the disposal chew them up for a deodorized drain.</li></ul>



<h2> Sanitizing the Sponges</h2>



<p> You can sanitize your sponge by tossing it into the microwave for ten to twenty seconds. It will kill all of the bacterial germs hiding in the nooks and crannies! Let them air dry thoroughly. Make an attempt to replace them every two weeks.</p>



<h2> Clean Small Appliances</h2>



<p> ● <strong>Toasters</strong>: Remove the crumbs from the toaster and toaster oven. Clean the racks with hot, soapy water to remove any food debris.<br> ● <strong>Can Opener</strong>: Take the opener apart and clean the cutter by soaking it in hot, soapy water. Scrub the blade with a scouring pad if necessary. Be careful, so you don’t get cut on the sharp blade.<br> ● <strong>The Blender</strong>: If you have ever tried to clean a blender, you know how involved the process can become. Simply add some soapy water in the blender, blend, rinse, and dry — no more hands on the sharp blades, or first aid kits necessary for the job.<br> ● Wipe all surfaces of the other small appliances.</p>



<h2>Clean the Microwave</h2>



<p> Remove any trays and wash them in hot, soapy water. Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe and scrub the entire unit. Be sure to spray the cleaner on the rag or sponge; not directly in the microwave.</p>



<p> You can also go the natural route with a few sliced lemons and a bowl of water in the microwave. Turn the unit on high until the microwave is steamy.<br> Let it steep for a few minutes to cut through the grease and grime. You can easily wipe out the moisture, and replace it with a fresh smelling space.</p>



<h2> Clean the Refrigerator</h2>



<p> Begin at the top of the refrigerator and remove everything. Clean out each shelf as you proceed. If any of the drawers or shelves are removable, take each unit out, and use warm soapy water to clean it. You want to clean every surface, especially the ones on the door—inside and out.</p>



<p> Before placing your food back inside of the fridge, line the shelves with some parchment paper or plastic food wrap to make cleaning a breeze. If you have a small mess, just remove the layer of plastic, and it is clean!</p>



<h2> Super-Clean the Oven</h2>



<p> Use natural products to clean the oven manually. You can choose from several techniques for general cleaning of your oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 1:</strong> Simply apply a layer of baking soda and spray it with a vinegar solution. It should form a paste. Leave the mixture on the surface of the oven for five minutes. Wipe the oven with a damp rag or sponge.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 2:</strong> First, take a look at one of the general natural cleaning options using baking soda:<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda<br> ● Water<br> ● Spray bottle<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Begin by spraying the oven with water, so it’s damp.</li><li>Sprinkle a ¼-inch layer of the soda, making sure you cover the entire surface.</li><li>If you see a dry spot, respray it with the water.</li><li>Let the mixture rest for at least three to four hours with the oven OFF.</li><li>Wipe the paste with an old towel to remove the grime.</li><li>It could take several applications, but thank goodness, it is natural.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 3:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, this will help remove the stuck-on grease and food.<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda (3 tbsp.)<br> ● Warm water (1 cup)<br> ● Castile soap (1 tbsp.)<br> Variations:<br> ● Lemon &amp; Clove: Add 5 drops each.<br> ● Lemon: Add 10 drops essential oil<br> ● Lemon &amp; Rosemary: Add 5 drops of each oil.<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Add all of the ingredients into a spray bottle. Shake well to mix.</li><li>To Use: Spray the oven liberally and let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li><li>Wipe it clean with a cloth or sponge. Rinse and let it air dry.</li><li>To Store: Store the leftovers for up to two weeks. Shake to<br> combine before using.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Manual Cleaning Ovens:</strong> <strong>Not Kid-Friendly:</strong> For tougher stains, you can use a commercial oven cleaner. You can also use a ½ cup of household ammonia.<br> Place the ammonia in a shallow pottery/glass container in the cold oven overnight. The burned-on food and grease will become loosened from the ammonia fumes.</p>



<p> Note: Don’t turn on the oven while the ammonia is inside of the oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Self-Cleaning Ovens:</strong> You are fortunate if you have a self-cleaning oven, but it also makes a mess with the ash left behind &#8211; similar to cigarette ashes. Clean up is simply wiping the ashes off the surfaces. If you don’t want to spend the extra time (anywhere from one to three hours) with an oven pumped up to 880 degrees; there is another way to clean those pesky spills.</p>



<p> <strong>Steam Cleaning Method: </strong>Choose the steam cleaning cycle which takes about 30 minutes.</p>



<ul><li>All you need to do is place one cup of water on the bottom of a cool oven.</li><li>Close the door and click the Steam Clean Cycle.</li></ul>



<p> The door won’t automatically lock, and it doesn’t involve any harsh chemicals. You also clean the racks while still in the oven. Wipe up the moisture and food debris and you are done!</p>



<p> <strong>Additional Helpful Usage Oven Tips:</strong></p>



<p> ● Never use commercial oven cleaners or liners of any type in or around any part of your self-cleaning oven.<br> ● Don’t use aluminum foil to catch any spillage.<br> ● Depending on the model the racks and pans might need to be removed. (Stainless steel must be removed.)</p>



<h2>Countertops &amp; The Backsplash</h2>



<p> Remove everything from the counters and thoroughly wipe down all of the surfaces using an all-purpose cleaner. Don’t forget the backsplash; it needs a good scrubbing also.</p>



<p> <strong>Special Countertops</strong><br> If you have white countertops, a cleaner with bleach included or soft-scrub (see the recipe) can be used for stubborn stains. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions, so you don’t damage the surfaces. These are the basics for four common countertops:</p>



<p> <strong>Stone Countertops: (Slate, Limestone, &amp; Soapstone):</strong><br> What You Need:<br> ● Warm, soapy water<br> ● A mild bleach solution<br> ● Or a non-abrasive cleaner</p>



<p> Note: Be sure to test a spot before you use anything other than warm, soapy water.</p>



<p> Grease Buildups: Use a mixture of white vinegar and water or an allpurpose cleaner.</p>



<p> You can also use a small brush such as a toothbrush to clean around the edges of the counters. Never use an abrasive pad because it will scratch the surface.</p>



<p> <strong>Butcher-Block Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> What You Need:</p>



<ul><li>Warm, soapy water</li><li>A mild bleach solution</li><li>A non-abrasive kitchen cleaner</li></ul>



<p> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Use a toothbrush along the edging to remove any debris.</li><li>If the surface feels tacky, use a baking soda and water paste.</li><li>Then, rinse thoroughly.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Ceramic Tile Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> You can use soap and water to clean ceramic tiles, but you need to be sure to rinse them thoroughly because soap can leave a filmy residue behind. Add some vinegar to the water to alleviate this issue. Never use an abrasive pad or cleaner.</p>



<p> Note: Even though the tile doesn’t stain easily—the grout will—with bacterial buildup as a result. Use a mild bleach solution and a toothbrush to clean the grout.</p>



<p> <strong>Concrete Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Clean the surface with warm and soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly.<br> You can use a mild bleach solution, but never use a scouring pad or abrasive cleaner on the surfaces.</p>



<p> For stubborn stains, you may also use talc mixed with a mixture of bleach, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste to the stained area, and use a soft brush to scrub the stain gently. Rinse thoroughly.</p>



<p> <strong>Marble Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Cleaning marble countertops is a bit different. It should be cleaned regularly with a soft, damp cloth (microfiber works well) to prevent streaks. Rinse it thoroughly to remove any residue. Wipe it dry because air drying can create water spots.</p>



<p> If acidic foods stain the surface such as wine, orange juice, or tomatoes; you may need to have the professionals clean the spot.</p>



<h2> The Cutting Board</h2>



<p> You have two choices to remove the leftover stains and smells on your cutting board using natural products. Use a lemon to scrub the board down.<br> You can also sprinkle some baking soda on the surface to remove some of the odors. Just rinse the board later and let it dry. You can also purchase plastic cutting boards that come in several colors for each type of food you would cut.</p>



<h2> Cabinets &#8211; Drawers &amp; Shelves</h2>



<p> Use a damp rag to clean any spills, spots, or splatters with an all-purpose cleaner. If you have wooden cabinets; use some Murphy’s Oil Soap, so the wood isn’t damaged. However, if the cabinets are new, it is best to ask the manufacturer or builder what works best on your particular cabinet.</p>



<p> <strong>Copper Pots</strong></p>



<p> Copper pots hanging in a kitchen makes it have a charming, homey effect.<br> Not only that, but it also saves a lot of space. However, you want to keep the surfaces shiny. Try one of these natural remedies that might surprise you:<br> ● <strong>Catsup</strong>: Give catsup a whirl; it will look really gross, but the acid will help cut through the tarnished surface.<br> ● <strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>: Pour some AC vinegar into a paper plate and let it soak. Rinse the pan and dry it completely.<br> ● <strong>Lemons &amp; Salt</strong>: Cut the lemon into wedges; dip a wedge into the salt, and rub the pan until it’s clean. Rinse the pan quickly and thoroughly in cold water, and wipe it dry.<br> ● <strong>Beer</strong>: Put some beer on the pot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes. Rinse and wipe it until dry and shiny.<br> ● <strong>Cottage Cheese</strong>: This is a cure that works without any scrubbing. Leave a layer of cottage cheese on the bottom for approximately five minutes. Rinse it completely and dry.</p>



<p> <strong>Stained Coffee Mugs:</strong></p>



<p> If you have stained coffee mugs, try this solution:<br> ● Also, try baking soda and water made into a paste.<br> ● This also works well on stained tea cups or coffee mugs, and even the cutting board.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The plan that you are going to use should define your starting point. It should also tell you the length of time you will need to complete the entire process.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Well-structured-Kitchen-683x1024.jpg" alt="Well-structured Kitchen" class="wp-image-1067"/></figure></div>



<p> When you step into your kitchen, the thought of organizing it sounds tiresome and time-consuming. However, you should not look at it that way knowing very well there is a lot in store for you to benefit from with a well-structured kitchen. The main question that you need to ask is, what are you looking to organize in your kitchen? From the first glance, what is the first thing that comes to your mind that should be organized? Perhaps it’s your junk drawer, or your knives, or the appliances that aren’t well-positioned. Maybe it’s the cabinets, cookbooks, drawers, or the refrigerator and freezer. If all these need to be organized, then you need a plan.</p>



<p> The plan that you are going to use should define your starting point. It should also tell you the length of time you will need to complete the entire process.<br> This is so you don’t end up wasting time cleaning the kitchen at the expense of other rooms.</p>



<h4>Why Start With a Plan?</h4>



<p> Working with a plan is the best way to ensure that you meet your organizational goals at the end of the day. The best thing is that a plan will also help you maintain your focus on what should be done at what time. What you should understand is that there are many things that should be organized in your kitchen. Therefore, if you fail to plan, you will find yourself moving from one corner to the other feeling frustrated and worn out that everything looks messy. In fact, you could end up losing hope that your kitchen can have an organized look, just as you had initially imagined.</p>



<p> The best way of planning your kitchen organization is walking into the room and deciding what you will do in a procedural manner. The following is a practical strategy that you can adopt as a plan to organize this room in your house.</p>



<h3> Step 1 &#8211; Categorize Your Items</h3>



<p> The first step you should take is to categorize what you have in your kitchen.<br> Knowing these categories will help you position everything in its rightful place. During this step, you should take everything out of your cabinets and list them in a notebook. Move from one cabinet to the other as you conduct this procedure without ignoring anything. Remember, you are also trying to avoid clutter from filling your kitchen, so nothing should be left untouched.</p>



<p> Moreover, to save on time, you should not dwell on specifics. Try to categorize your items based on general classifications. This will make the process easier for you to handle. Depending on what you have in your kitchen, there are several categories that you will have including plates, mugs, silverware, serving dishes, pans, cooking oils, spices, food storage, pet supplies, knives, pantry, and miscellaneous items.</p>



<h3> Step 2 -Use Sticky Notes to Identify Categories</h3>



<p> Handy tools that should not be left behind are sticky notes to help with the identification process. The categories you created in the first step should be labeled using a pen and a sticky note. Give each category a unique label and place them somewhere visible.</p>



<p> After labeling all your categories, it is worth noting that there are changes you will be making concerning the position of your items. This is what organization is all about. You want to store things in places where they can easily be accessed. If some of the things are rarely used, it makes more sense to store them in cabinets that aren’t located close to your workstations.</p>



<h3> Step 3 &#8211; Identify New Locations</h3>



<p> An important step in the planning process is knowing where your items will be stored. You should have a clear plan where your new storage locations will be. It is advisable to think about this based on proximity. With the sticky notes that you had previously labeled, use them to stick in the new locations where you wish to store your things.</p>



<p> Take note that you are not moving things around in this step. This is simply part of the planning. Don’t try to move items in your kitchen just yet as you will only confuse yourself. Simply place the sticky notes on the cabinets and drawers where you wish to store your goods. The significance of this step is that it helps you to visualize how things will look around your kitchen. You can move the stickers around until you get the desired look you anticipate.</p>



<p> After you are through placing your notes in different locations, you can take the next step of organizing. The important thing is that you should not remove the notes during the entire process.</p>



<p> You can see that having a solid plan will guarantee that you find it easy to rearrange things around your kitchen. Picture a scenario where you failed to plan how you will handle the process. Certainly, you will feel overwhelmed with the clutter. You will not know where to start and what to do to make your kitchen look good. This chapter has detailed for you a practical plan that you can use to kick off the process of organizing your kitchen. The important thing to keep in mind here is that you don’t have to complicate things as this will only discourage you.</p>
