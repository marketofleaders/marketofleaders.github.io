<p> In this article, I cover the basics and also let you in on some of best cooking and meal planning tips—from helpful hints on what ingredients to keep in your kitchen and which ones to avoid to fast prep solutions that will help you get meals on the table quickly. You’ll also learn five tricks to help you keep your portion sizes under control without feeling deprived. My approach to fuss-free weeknight cooking makes healthy eating a breeze.</p>



<h2> What to Eat</h2>



<p> Clean eating doesn’t mean you have to live off salads or that you can never eat dessert. It’s about focusing on real, minimally processed foods without added chemicals and cooking them in a way that uses healthy fats, herbs, and spices for a flavor boost. With that in mind, I’ve noted foods to enjoy to their fullest, those to limit to special occasions or enjoy in moderation, and foods to avoid when possible.</p>



<h4> ENJOY</h4>



<p> One of the best things about practicing clean eating is that you can enjoy most minimally processed, whole foods without limitation and without worrying about things like counting calories or tracking every bite you take. Bulk up your meals with ingredients like fresh fruits and vegetables; lean proteins such as fish, beans, and eggs; and nuts and seeds. You can also use herbs and spices, both fresh and dried, to add tons of flavor to your meals. If it doesn’t have an ingredient label or you can grow it in your garden, it likely belongs in this category. These ingredients should fill the majority of your plate. Additionally, try to incorporate them into your desserts and snacks as often as you can.</p>



<h4> LIMIT</h4>



<p> Some foods are okay in moderation, but, even though they’re generally healthy, they can quickly add a lot of calories to your plate if you aren’t careful. For the best success, limit sugars, including natural sugars such as honey and pure maple syrup, healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, and tahini, whole grains like brown rice and farro, and starchy vegetables like potatoes. Dairy and processed meats such as sausage or bacon also fall under this category, and always look for versions without added sugar, nitrates, or other additives. Use these ingredients to add a pop of flavor to your plate, but approach them as a treat to be enjoyed in small amounts.</p>



<h4> AVOID</h4>



<p> I’m not generally a fan of strict food rules or declaring certain foods off limits, but for long-term results, people who follow a clean-eating way of life should avoid some foods completely. This includes highly processed snacks and convenience food such as French fries and chips, commercially prepared cookies and pastries, and sugary drinks. You should also avoid artificial sweeteners—besides not having any nutritional value, studies have shown they can actually lead to overeating! Also be careful with low-fat and nonfat foods and check labels carefully. Some, like most fat-free Greek yogurts, are okay, but others are loaded with extra sugars and artificial ingredients to make up for the flavor and texture lost when removing the fat.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> HOW MUCH FOOD? A LOW-STRESS GUIDE TO PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>



<ul><li> <strong>Use a small plate.</strong> Ditch the dinner plate and use a salad plate instead. We eat with our eyes, and having a smaller plate that’s filled with food can seem more satisfying than the same amount of food presented on a larger plate.</li><li> <strong>Fill up with veggies.</strong> Vegetables are a healthy way to bulk up your meals, with their water and fiber content helping you feel full. Fill half your plate with vegetables or add a small side salad to your meal. You can also add fruits and vegetables to desserts. </li><li> <strong>Drink water.</strong> It’s easy to mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water, both with your meals and throughout the day, to stay satisfied. Aim for ½ to 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight per day.</li><li> <strong>Keep the leftovers in the kitchen</strong>. Instead of bringing everything to the table and eating family style, fix your plate in the kitchen and leave the leftovers there. That way, you’ll be less likely to have “just a little more.</li><li> <strong>Eat mindfully.</strong> Speaking of the table . . . eat there, not on the couch in front of the TV. You’ll be able to focus on enjoying your food without distraction and won’t accidentally finish everything on your plate without even realizing it—or tasting it.</li></ul>



<h2> Fast Prep Solutions</h2>



<p> The key to no-fuss cooking is all about being prepared. Here are some tips to help you prepare healthy recipes in a snap.</p>



<h4> Meal plan</h4>



<p> Spending a few minutes creating a plan for the week means no wasted time standing in front of the refrigerator wondering what to make and no extra trips to the grocery store for random ingredients you might not have.</p>



<h4> Batch cook</h4>



<p> Double or even triple recipes for pantry staples such as beans, rice and other grains, sauces, and stocks. They’ll keep in the refrigerator for a few days or frozen for longer-term storage. That way, you’ll have them ready to go when you need them.</p>



<h4> Embrace leftovers</h4>



<p> Cook once and eat twice! Make extra for dinner and enjoy leftovers for lunch the next day, or dinner again later in the week. You can also reimagine leftovers so you don’t get bored—enjoy Ratatouille as a side dish one night, then add it to pasta the next.</p>



<h4>Toss your peeler</h4>



<p> There’s no need to spend time peeling soft-skinned vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, or zucchini—just be sure to wash them well before cooking. And don’t worry about getting the perfect dice; just chop veggies to roughly the same size so they cook at the same pace.</p>



<h4>Plan ahead</h4>



<p> Mornings can be rushed, so I chop vegetables and measure any other ingredients for slow cooker meals the previous night. The next morning,  you only need to pull them out of the refrigerator, put them in the slow cooker, and turn it on!</p>



<h2>Refrigerator and Pantry Staples</h2>



<p> Stocking your kitchen with healthy foods, so everything is within easy reach and you’re not tempted by those chips or cookies, is one of the most important things you can do to set yourself up for weeknight cooking success. Following are some general ideas, but be sure to adapt them to your personal tastes—it doesn’t matter how much broccoli you have; if you don’t like it, you’ll never eat it.</p>



<h4> THE REFRIGERATOR</h4>



<p> <strong>Citrus fruits:</strong> Lemons and limes can be used in simple dressings and marinades and are an easy way to perk up flavors.</p>



<p> <strong>Fat-free Greek yogurt:</strong> Besides being an easy grab-and-go breakfast, you can use yogurt as a marinade for chicken or swirl it into soups and stews to add a creamy element or tone down spiciness.</p>



<p> <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> Herbs such as cilantro and basil add tons of instant flavor to simple recipes.</p>



<p> <strong>Green vegetables:</strong> Ingredients such as broccoli, zucchini, and bell peppers are a great starting place for most meals and mean a quick stir-fry is never far away.</p>



<p> <strong>Hard cheese:</strong> Hard cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Cheddar last a long time, and it only takes a little to add loads of flavor to your food.<br> Lean proteins: Quick-cooking lean proteins such as skinless chicken breast, shrimp, and eggs can be combined with other kitchen staples to create endless meal options.</p>



<p> <strong>Pizza dough:</strong> Pizza is delicious, but pizza dough can be used for so much more—bake it into rolls to go with soup, use it to make a meat pie, or turn it into cinnamon buns.</p>



<h4>THE PANTRY</h4>



<p> <strong>Canned tomatoes: </strong>Canned no-salt-added tomatoes are great in soups and stews, or for making a quick pasta sauce. I prefer fire-roasted varieties, which also add a subtle smoky element.</p>



<p> <strong>Dried herbs and spices: </strong>Pick one or two of your favorite international flavor profiles and stock up.<br> Having a variety of dried herbs and spices means you can make anything from Indian curries to Italian soups, even when fresh are not available.</p>



<p> <strong>Garlic and onions:</strong> Almost every recipe I make starts with at least one of these ingredients. I stock up every time I go to the grocery store.</p>



<p> <strong>Stock: </strong>I usually have homemade chicken and vegetable stock (see here and here) in my freezer, but I always keep a few cartons of low-sodium stock in the cabinet as backup. Use it to make a quick soup or add extra flavor to a pot of whole grains.</p>



<p> <strong>Whole grains:</strong> Rice, farro, and quinoa can form the base for many meals. Each has its own unique flavor, so I always have a good variety on hand to choose from.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Buy the best quality food you can easily afford, it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intuitive-Eating-For-Weight-Loss.jpg" alt="healthy eating" class="wp-image-988"/></figure></div>



<p> I’ve always felt that if food isn’t delicious, it isn’t worth eating. Healthy eating doesn’t mean going on fad diets—or even following a strict diet at all.</p>



<p> It’s about focusing on deliciously satisfying foods that nourish your body and soul—and making them a priority.</p>



<h3> The Golden Principles of Healthy Eating</h3>



<p> So, what is healthy eating? For starters, it means focusing on fresh, whole foods with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables, often referred to as clean eating. It also means choosing unrefined whole grains, such as whole-wheat flour, brown rice, and oats, over more processed options.</p>



<p> When you do venture into those inner aisles for items such as canned beans, packaged chicken stock, or spices, be sure to check the labels. Avoid chemicals and artificial flavors, and monitor for salt and added sugars.</p>



<p> Buy the best quality food you can easily afford—it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers. When it makes sense, look for organic produce and buy meat, dairy, and eggs from sustainable and local sources whose animals are raised humanely and without antibiotics, growth hormones, and other unnecessary restrictions such as being caged.</p>



<h3> The Logistical Challenge</h3>



<p> When you make the commitment to healthier eating habits, you’ll naturally want more control over the quality of the food you eat. That’s difficult when you’re relying on other people to prepare your food, whether it’s in the form of take-out meals or even prepared items from the grocery store. Prepared healthy, clean-eating options can be found, but they tend to be expensive.</p>



<p> The best and most cost-effective way to eat healthy is to make your own meals at home from whole, fresh ingredients. I get how challenging that can seem. We’re all busy; we get home late, and we’re tired. Throw in homework, laundry, after-school or after-work activities and who has the time to cook? Just the idea of cooking can be overwhelming—not to mention that endless pile of dishes that needs to be washed when you’re done.</p>



<p> Even though logistical challenges exist, healthy eating should be a priority. Along with physical activity, it’s crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. When I eat well, I feel better—and I have more energy.</p>



<h3> The One-Pot Solution</h3>



<p> Cooking dinner used to be the last thing I felt like doing after a long day. But once I discovered the beauty of one-pot cooking, my nightly routine was transformed. Now, instead of being tempted by take-out, I know a homemade meal made with nutritious ingredients is just a few minutes away. Plus, as there’s only one pot, cleanup is a breeze!</p>



<p> People have been making one-pot meals on their stovetops and in their ovens for decades, but modern kitchen appliances such as electric pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers make one-pot cooking easier—and healthier—than ever.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Berries</strong> are tiny colorful fruits that are packed full of fiber,minerals and vitamins. Although there are a lot of different kinds, among the most popular ones are blueberries, strawberries,blackberries, and raspberries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Berries are known to contain some antioxidants called anthocyanins.These substances have anti-inflammatory effects that will lower yourrisk of inflammation and disease.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg" alt="Fish" class="wp-image-576" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">.<br> ● <strong>Fish</strong> are a great source of protein. Everybody knows this.They also long-chains of omega-3 fatty acids. Although all types of fish contain some amount of omega-3 fatty acids, salmon, herring,mackerel, sardines, and anchovies are among the best sources. These kinds of fish are known to reduce inflammation that can cause metabolic syndrome, hepatitis, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.<br> When you eat fish, your body system breaks down these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have antiinflammatory effects. During clinical research, people consuming salmon or omega-3 fatty acid supplements had decreases in certain inflammatory markers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg" alt="Broccoli " class="wp-image-577" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Broccoli </strong>First of all, broccoli is highly nutritious. It is a cruciferous vegetable, along with some other veggies like cauliflower, brussels sprouts and kale. Studies have shown that consuming a generous amount of cruciferous veggies has been linked with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer.<br> This is believed to be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain. Broccoli also contains sulforaphane, an antioxidant that reduces inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and other proinflammatory substances which drive inflammation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg" alt="Avocados " class="wp-image-578" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Avocados </strong>Accept it. Avocado is a superfood worthy of the title. I never liked avocados growing up. They were green and tasted weird. But I discovered certain benefits of avocados and put some work into trying out various recipes I might like. I discovered a few but trust that there are certain ways I will never eat an avocado.<br> They are filled with potassium, magnesium, fiber and healthy monounsaturated fats, and they also contain certain compounds called carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to the reduction of cancer risks. In addition, certain compounds in avocados may reduce inflammation in young skin cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In one study, people were asked to consume a slice of avocado with a hamburger. After a period of time, it was discovered that they had lower levels of the inflammatory markers than participants who ate just the hamburger.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg" alt="Green tea" class="wp-image-579" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Green tea</strong> Everybody drinks one green tea or another these days.I don&#8217;t blame them,It has immense benefits. You&#8217;ve probably heard that green tea is one of the healthiest drinks you can take. It is known to reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, obesity and other inflammatory problems. Many of its benefits are due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances it contains, especially a substance known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).EGCG reduces inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. It also prevents damage to the fatty acids in your cells. Varieties of green teas can be found in stores all around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg" alt="Peppers" class="wp-image-580" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Peppers</strong> don&#8217;t exactly feel or taste pleasant. Despite the flavour they add to certain meals, they are known for a signature burn, some more than others. They have anti-inflammatory properties and that make them an essential in our diet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bell peppers and chili peppers are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants that inhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Bell peppers contain the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce at least one marker of oxidative damage in people with an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis. Chili peppers contain compounds like sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which can reduce inflammation and lead to more life expectancy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg" alt="Mushrooms" class="wp-image-581" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Mushrooms </strong>are those adorable little umbrella plants that are believed to house pixies and while hundreds of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible. Others are poisonous.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trick to being able to differentiate between good mushrooms and bad mushrooms lies somewhere on Google. You should find it. To save you the trouble, the good mushrooms include truffles,portobello mushrooms, and shiitake.<br> Mushrooms are considered to be very low in calories but rich in selenium, copper and the entire B vitamin family. They are also packed with phenols and other antioxidants that provide antiinflammatory aid. A special kind of mushroom called lion&#8217;s mane may potentially reduce the low-grade inflammation seen in obese individuals. Also, one study found that cooking mushrooms lowered their anti-inflammatory compounds so it may be best to eat them raw.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg" alt="Grape" class="wp-image-582" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Grape </strong>Round, beautiful, tasty and apparently, anti-inflammatory.Grapes contain substances like anthocyanins which reduce inflammation. Also, they can decrease the risk of several diseases,including heart problems, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and some eye disorders.<br> Grapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol, another substance known for its many health benefits. In one study, people with heart problems consumed grape extract daily and experienced a significant decrease in inflammatory gene markers. Another interesting fact is that their levels of adiponectin increased. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg" alt="Turmeric " class="wp-image-583" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Turmeric </strong>is a yellow or orange spice with a strong,earthy flavor that is often used in curries and other Indian dishes. It has received a lot of attention for its content of the powerful antiinflammatory substance called curcumin. Turmeric is proven to be effective at reducing the inflammation related to hepatitis, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Turmeric is THE superfood of superfoods!<br> A study showed that one gram of curcumin everyday mixed with piperine from black pepper caused a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP in people with metabolic syndrome. The problem however is that it may be hard to get enough curcumin to have a noticeable effect from just turmeric. It needs to be combined with other substances to get the full experience. In one study, obese women who took 2.8 grams of turmeric everyday had no improvement whatsoever in inflammatory markers.<br> If you can&#8217;t seem to find anything to combine turmeric with, taking supplements containing isolated curcumin is also effective.<br> Curcumin supplements are usually combined with piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by a lot! Turmeric is also used as a face mask for skin inflammation, but it is not as effective on its own as it will be when mixed with other things like milk, lemon, honey, oatmeal, and so on.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong>, is one of the healthiest kinds of fat you can eat. It is rich in monounsaturated fats and an essential in the Mediterranean diet, which provides immense health benefits. Research links extra virgin olive oil to a significantly reduced risk of heart disease, brain cancer and other major health conditions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lovely green goodness<br> In one Mediterranean diet study, some inflammatory markers significantly decreased in those who consumed 50 ml of olive oil daily. The effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, can been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or diclofenac. Don&#8217;t forget that anti-inflammatory benefits are much greater in extra virgin olive oil than in more refined olive oils. It&#8217;s very easy to find extra virgin olive oil in your neighbourhood grocery store, but you can also buy it online.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg" alt="Dark chocolate" class="wp-image-585" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Dark chocolate</strong> Chocolate as an anti-inflammatory food? Oh yeah! Dark chocolate is absolutely delicious, rich, satisfying and a way for life for some good folks like myself. It is also loaded with antioxidants that reduce inflammation. Dark chocolate can actually reduce your risk of inflammation and heart disease.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dark chocolate! My precioussssss.<br>
Flavanols &#8211; the anti-inflammatory substance in dark chocolate &#8211; are responsible for chocolate&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effects and keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy. In one clinical study, smokers experienced significant improvement in endothelial function few hours after eating chocolate that&#8217;s high in flavonol. Make sure to always choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa -more is always better &#8211; in order to get the anti-inflammatory benefits.<br>
You can buy that chocolate bar now.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Tomatoes </strong>The tomato is another superfood. It is high in nutrients and has many healing properties include fixing sunburns!<br> Tomatoes are very high in vitamin C, potassium and lycopene, the antioxidant with impressive anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is also particularly beneficial for reducing pro-inflammatory compounds related to several kinds of cancer.<br> Clinical studies have determined that drinking tomato juice significantly decreased inflammatory markers in overweight women.<br> It doesn&#8217;t work as much in obese women though.Cooking tomatoes in olive oil can maximize the amount of lycopene available for absorption. What did you expect from the combination of two very powerful anti inflammatory foods? Tomatoes can be eaten raw or cooked. They&#8217;re a key component of pasta sauce, vegetable salad,sandwiches and others.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Cinnamon </strong>is a very delicious spice with a distinctive smell. It contains a compound called cinnamaldehyde which is responsible for inhibiting certain proteins such as actin and C-reactive protein, which can lead to inflammation.<br> Cinnamaldehyde also works by stopping unwanted agglutination of blood platelets that can lead to inflammation by sending signals for the release of arachidonic acid and reducing the formation of thromboxane A2. Too much cinnamon may cause breathing difficulties so take it in moderation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1.jpg" alt="Ginger " class="wp-image-588" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Ginger </strong>Apart from being a delicious addition to a wide range of meals, ginger is stacked with a lot of health benefits beyond inflammation. It is known to improve metabolism and help fight oxidative damage. Studies have shown that the compounds gingerol and zingerone found in ginger are solely responsible for the root&#8217;s ability to fight inflammation. They have been linked to reductions in many forms of inflammation, from colitis to kidney damage to diabetes and hepatitis.<br> The absolute best way to consume ginger is to eat the raw root.Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. Although it may be difficult for your body to break down the fiber, it is the best way to get all the anti-inflammatory substances absorbed into your body. However, for the faint of heart, it is also available in powder and supplement form.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The everyday act of consuming food should never bring you a feeling of captivity or worry. In a supercharged life, food is to be enjoyed and savoured. Here, we walk to the unforced rhythms that come with a commonsense attitude towards food and a balanced approach to eating. Letting go of a rule-bound approach to eating will bring you a sense of freedom, but still allow you to commit to food choices that equate to vibrant health and longevity – and a life fully lived.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve pulled together a list here of the basic commonsense eating guidelines I live by. Instead of being motivated by the fear of negative consequences, why not try to implement one or more of these in your life?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/06/aubergines-bio-cabbage-5205-1.jpg" alt="Post" class="wp-image-414"/></figure>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong> Eat mostly plants<br>Despite the vast differences in doctrine between the mainstream and alternative nutrition experts, the one thing we can all agree on is that eating plant foods is really good. I like to ensure that plant foods – such as nuts, seeds, fruits, grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa, buckwheat), fruits, sea vegetables, herbs and spices – make up the majority of my diet, with the greatest emphasis on seasonal vegetables and especially greens. I still enjoy animal products such as meat, eggs, fish, cheese, butter and ghee, but in smaller quantities.</td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/06/supermarket-949912_1280-1.jpg" alt="Post" class="wp-image-412"/></figure>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>2</strong> Avoid processed foods where you can<br>Industrially produced foods that your ancestors wouldn’t comprehend are best eaten in small amounts. Any ingredient with a number, or a name that doesn’t register as ‘food’ when you read it, probably isn’t food. Stick to things that are foods, in as natural a state as possible. If a laboratory or factory has done most of the preparation, it’s probably better to leave it on the supermarket shelf.</td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/06/cake-1571747_1280-1.jpg" alt="Post" class="wp-image-359"/></figure>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>3</strong> Live by the 80:20 rule<br>Sticking to your nutritional values 80 per cent of the time will allow you a healthy margin where you can say yes to the chocolate cake at your friends’ birthday parties, or enjoy a big slab of pizza as you travel through Naples. There are food opportunities in life that just can’t be ignored or turned down. Don’t be that killjoy. Allowing yourself the space to stray from your regular nourishing eating habits will help you not to take yourself too seriously, and will bring freedom to your social food situations. Twenty per cent indulgence won’t do you any harm if you’re otherwise healthy.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>4</strong> Balance out your eating<br>Eating is all about balance. If you’ve been out of your normal routine while at work or on holidays and found you’ve overindulged in a specific food, spend the next few days nourishing yourself back to homoeostasis (metabolic balance) with the foods you’ve been missing. If you’ve spent a few days eating lots of starchy, cooked foods, for example, it might be a good idea to spend a couple of days eating some raw and lighter foods through vegie juices, salads and vegetable soups.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>5</strong> Take an Ayurvedic approach<br>Traditional  Ayurvedic medicine teaches us that we attain health when we eat a practical balance of different types of foods from the taste categories of bitter, sweet, sour, salty, astringent and pungent.Having a varied diet of different tastes,eating seasonally, and ensuring the right balance of cooked and cold foods helps the nervous system recognise nourishment. You can work out your ideal Ayurvedic eating plan by determining your dosha, which will help you eat in a commonsense way for your unique body type.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>6</strong> Choose quality over quantity<br>This is especially true with animal products. Overall, try to invest in better-quality food that’s chemical-free or organic. Shop at local farmers’ markets rather than supermarkets if possible. With animal products, look for organic or 100 per cent grass-fed and grass-finished. It’s better to enjoy smaller amounts of quality food than gorging on food that’s cheap and of lower quality.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>7</strong> Eat mindfully<br>Do what the French do and make an occasion of your meal, even if it’s just morning or afternoon tea. Unplug, turn off the TV, sit at the table, use proper dinnerware, eat with friends and family, and give thanks. Tune in to all your senses and pay attention to enjoying and savouring each glorious mouthful. Enjoy the following morning and afternoon tea delights.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take a fresh look at salads and you’ll see there are a lot of exciting developments in the salad bowl. Banished forever is the image of salads as dull diet food consisting of little more than limp lettuce and soggy, flavorless tomatoes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today, salads are one of the ultimate health foods. They can contain an exciting variety of colorful, delicious, and satisfying ingredients that provide the nutrients essential for healthy living. Remember, salads aren’t just for summer. We have plenty of ideas for salads that brighten and lighten winter mealtimes, too. In fact, once you get into the habit of thinking “salad” while menu planning, ideas will also come to you whatever the time of the year as you push your shopping cart along the supermarket aisles or stop at the cheese counter or produce department.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
are versatile enough to cater for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Meat,
seafood, and poultry are ideal salad ingredients, along with the perhaps more
commonly used lettuce and other leaves, vegetables, fruit, herbs, nuts, seeds,
grains, legumes, and cheese. And with so many ingredients to choose from,
salads can be as simple and light or complex and filling as you like. They also
have the added bonus that they are versatile enough to fit easily into all your
meal plans, from first courses through to desserts.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of
chicken salad doesn’t excite because you’ve been making the same recipe out of
habit for as long as you can remember, try Thai-Style Chicken Salad. You’ll
never think of chicken salad as humdrum again!</p>



<h1>Bowls of Goodness</h1>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It
wasn’t long ago that when “salads” and “health” were linked it was in the
context of weight-reducing diets that were restrictive and ultimately
unsatisfying. Today, however, salads are a delicious component of a healthy
diet, giving you endless variety at mealtimes without long hours in the
kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">With
fresh produce from all corners of the globe readily available in supermarkets
and gourmet food stores, you can enjoy a variety of salads all year round but,
remember, salads are at their most flavorsome and nutritious when made with
seasonal produce in its prime.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We
are all being urged to eat more fruit and vegetables every day, and a salad a
day can go a long way to help you meet the minimum target of 2½ cups for
adults. Enjoy a bowl of Traditional Greek Salad or Three-Color Salad, for
example, and you’ll be more than halfway to success. What could be easier—or
more enjoyable?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
also make great accompaniments, served alongside a filling bowl of pasta or a
plate of hot or cold roast meat.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green leaves with a simple oil-and-vinegar dressing, it’s definitely time to think again. And don’t make the mistake of thinking all salad ingredients have to be raw, either. Adding small amounts of cooked meat, poultry and seafood to lettuce leaves and other vegetables gives you a satisfying meal. If you want a meal-in-a-bowl, try Roast Pork with Pumpkin, Smoked Chicken Salad with Avocado &amp; Tarragon Dressing, and Shrimp &amp; Rice Salad, for example. There are plenty of vegetarian main-course salads, too, such as the Middle Eastern favorite Tabbouleh and Buckwheat Noodle Salad with Smoked Tofu.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cooked vegetables also make good salad ingredients. Grilled peppers, fried eggplants, blanched beans of all varieties, and peas are just some of the cooked vegetables.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">So,
if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green
