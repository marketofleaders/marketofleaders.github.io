<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>A dog breed will consistently produce the desired physical traits, movement, and temperament that was developed over decades of selective breeding.</p>



<p>Dog&#8217;s acts and reacts can be due to how much socialization and handling they received as a youngster, how well the owner trained them after taking them home, and&#8211;of course&#8211;the genetic luck of the draw. In the end, your dog&#8217;s preferences and personality are as individual as you are&#8211;and if you can accept that, you&#8217;re bound to enjoy each other&#8217;s companionship for life.</p>



<p>In this quiz, you were given 10 questions and you had to choose one answer from the choices. You get the result at the end which told you which DOG BREED you are.</p>



<p>Do not think too much, because the best results are your first instinct to react. Once you have chosen the answer, you can only change it at the end of the quiz.</p>



<p>Enjoy the quiz, if you like it, share the result with your best friends.</p>

<p>Intermittent fаѕting hаѕ become quietly popular in сirсlеѕ whеrе реорlе аrе striving to соmе up with wауѕ tо reduce caloric intake withоut hаrming thеir workout gоаlѕ and ѕtill allow them to lоѕе wеight while ѕtrеngth<br>training.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fasting.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1461" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fasting.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fasting-300x262.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p>Intеrmittеnt fаѕting in a nutѕhеll is thе рrасtiсе of ѕhоrt-tеrm fasts that are<br>24 hours in lеngth and done once оr twice реr wееk. Thеrе are vаriаtiоnѕ оn thаt theme, but in gеnеrаl, thаt iѕ the nоrm. Thiѕ is dоnе not ѕо muсh to<br>&#8220;сlеаnѕе the system&#8221; аѕ many would have уоu bеliеvе, though it will tо a<br>certain dеgrее. It&#8217;s merely a simple аnd fаѕt wау оf decreasing саlоriс intаkе so уоu can асhiеvе уоur wеight lоѕѕ gоаlѕ withоut starvation рlаnѕ оr оthеr fаd diеtѕ. You dоn&#8217;t hаvе tо bе оvеrlу соnсеrnеd аbоut the tуреѕ of fооd you соnѕumе while уоu&#8217;rе not fasting, аlthоugh it ѕhоuld be noted that fаѕting оnсе or twiсе per week won&#8217;t really hеlр уоu rеасh уоur goals if уоu spend thе оthеr five or six days ѕtuffing уоurѕеlf with аll manner of junk. A bit more care and consciousness is required.</p>



<p>Bу аllоwing a ѕеnѕe of frееdоm in уоur food choices, it relieves a great<br>dеаl of thе anxiety рrеѕеnt when it соmеѕ tо mоѕt diets. Many times wе fееl<br>tоtаllу соnѕtrаinеd and restricted. However, this аррrоасh leaves us being<br>аblе to nоt оnlу сhооѕе what wе&#8217;d likе to consume, but also bringѕ bаlаnсе<br>аnd ѕаnitу back into оur diets. Intеrmittеnt fаѕting as a lifеѕtуlе will bring аbоut сhаngеѕ thаt will lаѕt a lifеtimе. Stаrt by tаking it slow аt first, аnd<br>really learn tо liѕtеn to what уоur bоdу iѕ trying tо tеll уоu аѕ уоu gо thrоugh your firѕt fеw weeks оf this. If уоu find уоurѕеlf fееling lеthаrgiс or underfed, change it up a bit. Yоur bоdу will tеll уоu whаt it nееdѕ. (And that uѕuаllу iѕn&#8217;t a monster double сhееѕеburgеr!) Mаnу timеѕ, еѕресiаllу аt firѕt, уоur bоdу will bе gоing through some withdrаwаlѕ, and it&#8217;s imроrtаnt tо learn how to differentiate thе signals. Also, уоu need to fасtоr in whаt еffесt аnу workout rоutinеѕ you mау be invоlvеd in will hаvе оn уоur intermittent fаѕting рlаnѕ.</p>



<p>The mоѕt imроrtаnt thing tо remember аbоut intermittent fаѕting is thаt it<br>iѕ nоt merely a diеt рlаn, but a lifеѕtуlе, wоrthу of соnѕidеrаtiоn аlоng those linеѕ. In оrdеr tо get thе bеѕt rеѕultѕ роѕѕiblе from this tуре оf рlаn, уоu nееd tо bеfriеnd it. Your fasting ѕhоuld be ѕоmеthing thаt you look fоrwаrd to, as уоu mоѕt certainly will аftеr you ѕtаrt reaping ѕоmе of thе benefits of thiѕ intermittent fasting lifеѕtуlе. Mаking thiѕ type оf рlаn fits intо your life iѕ kеу tо making a lifеtimе of gооd eating and healthy living possible. There аrе a lоt оf inhеrеnt frееdоmѕ built intо a diet рlаn likе thiѕ, and whilе thаt саn bасkfirе on уоu if уоu&#8217;rе not careful, it can аlѕо enable lаѕting ѕuссеѕѕ.</p>

Thiѕ iѕ often more attainable fоr реорlе because they fееl lеѕѕ dерrivеd when they are аblе tо аt least еаt ѕоmеthing dаilу and it ѕtill hаѕ mоѕt оf the bеnеfitѕ оf the ADF regimen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The word ‘ketogenic’ originated from ‘ketones,’ from which ‘keto’ is derived.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast.jpg" alt="appetizer-avocado-breakfast" class="wp-image-1297" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> The word ‘ketogenic’ originated from ‘ketones,’ from which ‘keto’ is derived. Ketones are a small fuel molecule used as an alternative to providing sugar in the body when glucose (blood sugar) is short in supply. When you are low on carbs, your body goes through a metabolic state known as ketosis.</p>



<p> Ketosis is characterized by a rise in the level of ketones in the system. Here you start burning glucose due to the lack of energy. Keto diets, unlike other low-carb diets, are centered on this macronutrient which supplies about 90% of the body&#8217;s calories. Ketones are created from fats, and they provide energy to the whole body, particularly to the brain. The brain is the powerhouse of the human body, and it is always working. Even when you are asleep.</p>



<p> However, it cannot run directly on fat, unless it gets converted into either glucose or ketones.</p>



<p> Whenever there is a drop in the level of insulin in your body, the amount of fat that your system burns spikes because the stored fats become more accessible and make it easier for your body to utilize them. It is a fact that burning fat is one of the easiest ways to shed a few pounds. </p>



<p> This process is also beneficial for the body, in the sense that it gives you enough energy and reduces the number of times that you get hungry and helps you stay alert and focused throughout the day. When you are on a keto diet, your body begins to run on fat all day long, so it is perfect for getting your weight under your control since it burns fats 24/7.</p>



<p> Once you have decided to go on a keto diet, you should avoid too much protein because it can easily interfere with ketosis. That’s why you need to employ some tricks, as well as a conscious effort, to get the results you desire. </p>



<p> For instance, you must eat very low levels of carbohydrates in a day. Keep in mind that there are foods with extremely high levels of carbs, e.g., banana. There are about 27 grams of carbs in a medium sized banana. </p>



<p> When you start on a keto diet, you should also remember that reaching ketosis does not take place overnight. Retraining your liver to produce ketones is not an easy feat. It typically takes a few days to get to this metabolic state.</p>



<p> In summary, the keto diet is a low-carbohydrate diet, which is used to burn fat more easily and quickly by allowing you to consume more fats than carbohydrates. It follows a dietary plan of about 60 to 70% fat, 15 to 30% protein, and 5 to 10% carbs (Perfect Keto, n.d.).</p>



<p> Generally, it is considered to be safe for almost everybody, but there are some groups of people to whom special consideration should be given. Those on medication for diabetes or hypertension, as well as mothers that are breastfeeding, should consult with their doctor before starting any diet or lifestyle changes.</p>

<p> You can minimalize your kitchen in several ways. Among them, you can spend a whole day, or if you have little time you can use these recommendations which will take you not more than 15 minutes a day to accomplish. Below, we will show you how to minimalize your kitchen step by step. </p>



<h3> <strong>Step 1: Start in The Pantry</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg" alt="pantry" class="wp-image-1176" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://www.playtalklearn.com/">playtalklearn.com</a>  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Start by reviewing the due dates and throw away everything that you will not be able to use before the due dates. Then review what has not expired and keep only what you’ll really use within their shelf life. It’s time to go! Throw them out! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 2: Refrigerator and Freezer</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg" alt="organizing my fridge" class="wp-image-1059" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Repeat the steps of the pantry for the refrigerator and freezer. Do not forget to clean every space that you are going to minimize. There is something about seeing a clean space, which makes you think about what you are going to put there. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 3: Plastic Containers</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg" alt="Containers" class="wp-image-1183" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcrecycles/4074783459">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>  By minimizing your containers, just like crockery. It is important to take into account how many are in the house and how many are used. This will help you not to get rid of anything that you really need. Besides that, it will give you the opportunity to keep those that you really use and inspire you. For some reason, it is one of the elements that seem to multiply by themselves. </p>



<p> Once you know what you use and how many of it you need, it&#8217;s time to get rid of the rest. There is no need to have thousands of useless containers in your space. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 4: Pots and Pans</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg" alt="Pots and Pans" class="wp-image-1178" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/r4andred/511125951/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Once again, think about the preparations you make to know what utensils you actually use. You will see that you hardly really need that collection of pots of all sizes. By now you already know what to do with the ones you don’t need. </p>



<h3><strong> Step 5: Molds for Oven</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg" alt="Molds" class="wp-image-1163" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> With the preparations you usually make in mind; be honest with yourself and keep those molds that you will truly use. </p>



<p> Do not kid yourself thinking that maybe later you might need some of these.<br> The reality is that if you have not used it until now (or only once) there is not much chance that you will need it. As it is something sporadic it is better to borrow it and save yourself having it saved all your life just for that one time. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 6: Crockery</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg" alt="crockery" class="wp-image-1177" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> How many are in the house? This is the fundamental question to minimize your tableware. You do not need 15 dishes if there are only 3 in the house for example. </p>



<p> Maybe you wonder what I do when I receive visitors? Well, simple. Make sure to have a package of cardboard plates and cutlery in case of having visitors. Not only will it save you space, but you will not have to wash off more when someone comes. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 7: Cutlery and Ladles</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg" alt="Cutlery and Ladles" class="wp-image-1180" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Like crockery, you do not need more than the number of people in the house.<br> Why do you have a drawer full of forks, spoons, and knives when in reality you only use a couple of each? </p>



<h3><strong>Step 8: Home Appliances</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg" alt="Home Appliances" class="wp-image-1181" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg 725w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></figure></div>



<p> A secret that can help you keep your kitchen clear is &#8211; try to use your utensils in more ways than one. And this applies to each of the previous points as well. </p>



<p> By minimizing the number of appliances you have, you not only clear your kitchen and simplify your life, but you have the opportunity to sell what you do not use and make some money in the attempt. </p>



<p> Keep what you really use, do not keep things thinking of a day you will use it. Get rid of kitchenware tools you do not need after separating the things you really use! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 9: Others</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg" alt="kitchenware" class="wp-image-1182" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97226447@N00/7412770556/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>

Some kitchenware tools like a chopping board, drainer, and potatoes peeler, among others can come handy on a good day.<br> You do not have to love cooking, but it should not be a torture either. The fewer utensils you have, the less time you spend washing, organizing and cleaning. You will see that it becomes more bearable when everything handy.

<p> <strong>Pull-Out Pantries</strong><br> If you’ve been to a kitchen with pull-out pantries, then you know these storage spaces are indeed worth having in any modern kitchen.

					<description><![CDATA[When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-Zones.jpg" alt="Kitchen Zones" class="wp-image-1194"/></figure></div>



<p>For decades, most people had embraced the idea of arranging their kitchen using the “kitchen-triangle” layout. The layout had a particular position for the sink, refrigerator, and stove. They were organized in a way that a person wouldn’t need to take several steps before accessing any of the areas. There are some kitchens that still use this layout to this day. However, with the evolution of the kitchen space, this layout no longer applies to large kitchens.</p>



<p> When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.<br> Common zones that you should expect in any kitchen include the cooking zone, cleaning zone, and the storage zone. Understanding the purpose of these zones guarantees that you organize your kitchen in the best way possible. This chapter takes a closer look at how these zones should look.</p>



<h2> The Prep Zone</h2>



<p> Just as the name suggests, this is the area where you prepare yourself to cook.<br> There are several activities that you can do including washing, slicing, peeling, chopping, and draining right before the actual cooking begins. When baking, there are many activities that will take place before the cooking begins. It is vital that you move from one zone to the other systematically when cooking. Usually, these zones will overlap.</p>



<p> It’s important to have sufficient space to conduct all the activities that take place in the prep zone. For that reason, you should consider uncluttering the kitchen counters here. Also, you should utilize the storage spaces in the prep zone wisely to ensure that you minimize overlapping from one end to the other. Use the storage strategy where you store items based on usage.</p>



<p> The prep zone will have a few cabinets for you to store what you will use during meal preparation. Make sure that your organization creates room for accessibility. Don’t store unwanted things in these cabinets because other cabinets are full. Everything in your kitchen has its home. If not, then consider storing in your junk drawer or donating.</p>



<h2> The Cooking Zone</h2>



<p> The cooking zone will feature a number of things around your kitchen including the stove cooktop and several appliances that you use most often.<br> The warming drawer or a microwave will be found here. Also, keep in mind that breakfast is a common meal to most people, and a toaster or coffee maker could also be found in the cooking zone. Stocking the cooking zone should be done appropriately. This means that the drawers and cabinets in this section should be used for cooking purposes. You should store baking pans, utensils, pots, cookie sheets, etc. in these storage spaces.</p>



<h2>The Cleaning Zone</h2>



<p> Depending on the size of your kitchen, there are several cleaning zones that you will have in your kitchen. Regardless, this area is usually in close proximity with the sink. The trash bins are also part of this zone because they are the sections that help in keeping your kitchen free from dirt. The cooking process will begin and end here. Before preparing any meal, you will have to wash the ingredients. Once you are done eating, it’s in the cleaning zone where you will wash the dirty dishes.</p>



<p> The cleaning area should not be far from the cooking zone or the prep zone.<br> In fact, larger kitchens can have several sinks next to the prep area for convenience purposes. It should also be noted that it can be a great idea to position the washing area close to a window. This provides you with natural ambience to enjoy while cleaning the dishes. Ideally, this can be a great place to cool off your mind and enjoy a healthy conversation with anyone giving you company as you clean.</p>



<h2> The Storage Zone</h2>



<p> This is one major area that will have a profound impact on how your kitchen looks. Failure to use the storage area appropriately can ruin the good look of your kitchen. Your kitchen might appear spacious, but if things are not stored in their right places you might feel suffocated.</p>



<p> There are numerous storage ideas that you can utilize to give your kitchen a simplified yet comprehensive look. Some of these hacks are succinctly discussed in the following lines.</p>

<p> In this article, I cover the basics and also let you in on some of best cooking and meal planning tips—from helpful hints on what ingredients to keep in your kitchen and which ones to avoid to fast prep solutions that will help you get meals on the table quickly. You’ll also learn five tricks to help you keep your portion sizes under control without feeling deprived. My approach to fuss-free weeknight cooking makes healthy eating a breeze.</p>



<h2> What to Eat</h2>



<p> Clean eating doesn’t mean you have to live off salads or that you can never eat dessert. It’s about focusing on real, minimally processed foods without added chemicals and cooking them in a way that uses healthy fats, herbs, and spices for a flavor boost. With that in mind, I’ve noted foods to enjoy to their fullest, those to limit to special occasions or enjoy in moderation, and foods to avoid when possible.</p>



<h4> ENJOY</h4>



<p> One of the best things about practicing clean eating is that you can enjoy most minimally processed, whole foods without limitation and without worrying about things like counting calories or tracking every bite you take. Bulk up your meals with ingredients like fresh fruits and vegetables; lean proteins such as fish, beans, and eggs; and nuts and seeds. You can also use herbs and spices, both fresh and dried, to add tons of flavor to your meals. If it doesn’t have an ingredient label or you can grow it in your garden, it likely belongs in this category. These ingredients should fill the majority of your plate. Additionally, try to incorporate them into your desserts and snacks as often as you can.</p>



<h4> LIMIT</h4>



<p> Some foods are okay in moderation, but, even though they’re generally healthy, they can quickly add a lot of calories to your plate if you aren’t careful. For the best success, limit sugars, including natural sugars such as honey and pure maple syrup, healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, and tahini, whole grains like brown rice and farro, and starchy vegetables like potatoes. Dairy and processed meats such as sausage or bacon also fall under this category, and always look for versions without added sugar, nitrates, or other additives. Use these ingredients to add a pop of flavor to your plate, but approach them as a treat to be enjoyed in small amounts.</p>



<h4> AVOID</h4>



<p> I’m not generally a fan of strict food rules or declaring certain foods off limits, but for long-term results, people who follow a clean-eating way of life should avoid some foods completely. This includes highly processed snacks and convenience food such as French fries and chips, commercially prepared cookies and pastries, and sugary drinks. You should also avoid artificial sweeteners—besides not having any nutritional value, studies have shown they can actually lead to overeating! Also be careful with low-fat and nonfat foods and check labels carefully. Some, like most fat-free Greek yogurts, are okay, but others are loaded with extra sugars and artificial ingredients to make up for the flavor and texture lost when removing the fat.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> HOW MUCH FOOD? A LOW-STRESS GUIDE TO PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>



<ul><li> <strong>Use a small plate.</strong> Ditch the dinner plate and use a salad plate instead. We eat with our eyes, and having a smaller plate that’s filled with food can seem more satisfying than the same amount of food presented on a larger plate.</li><li> <strong>Fill up with veggies.</strong> Vegetables are a healthy way to bulk up your meals, with their water and fiber content helping you feel full. Fill half your plate with vegetables or add a small side salad to your meal. You can also add fruits and vegetables to desserts. </li><li> <strong>Drink water.</strong> It’s easy to mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water, both with your meals and throughout the day, to stay satisfied. Aim for ½ to 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight per day.</li><li> <strong>Keep the leftovers in the kitchen</strong>. Instead of bringing everything to the table and eating family style, fix your plate in the kitchen and leave the leftovers there. That way, you’ll be less likely to have “just a little more.</li><li> <strong>Eat mindfully.</strong> Speaking of the table . . . eat there, not on the couch in front of the TV. You’ll be able to focus on enjoying your food without distraction and won’t accidentally finish everything on your plate without even realizing it—or tasting it.</li></ul>



<h2> Fast Prep Solutions</h2>



<p> The key to no-fuss cooking is all about being prepared. Here are some tips to help you prepare healthy recipes in a snap.</p>



<h4> Meal plan</h4>



<p> Spending a few minutes creating a plan for the week means no wasted time standing in front of the refrigerator wondering what to make and no extra trips to the grocery store for random ingredients you might not have.</p>



<h4> Batch cook</h4>



<p> Double or even triple recipes for pantry staples such as beans, rice and other grains, sauces, and stocks. They’ll keep in the refrigerator for a few days or frozen for longer-term storage. That way, you’ll have them ready to go when you need them.</p>



<h4> Embrace leftovers</h4>



<p> Cook once and eat twice! Make extra for dinner and enjoy leftovers for lunch the next day, or dinner again later in the week. You can also reimagine leftovers so you don’t get bored—enjoy Ratatouille as a side dish one night, then add it to pasta the next.</p>



<h4>Toss your peeler</h4>



<p> There’s no need to spend time peeling soft-skinned vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, or zucchini—just be sure to wash them well before cooking. And don’t worry about getting the perfect dice; just chop veggies to roughly the same size so they cook at the same pace.</p>



<h4>Plan ahead</h4>



<p> Mornings can be rushed, so I chop vegetables and measure any other ingredients for slow cooker meals the previous night. The next morning,  you only need to pull them out of the refrigerator, put them in the slow cooker, and turn it on!</p>



<h2>Refrigerator and Pantry Staples</h2>



<p> Stocking your kitchen with healthy foods, so everything is within easy reach and you’re not tempted by those chips or cookies, is one of the most important things you can do to set yourself up for weeknight cooking success. Following are some general ideas, but be sure to adapt them to your personal tastes—it doesn’t matter how much broccoli you have; if you don’t like it, you’ll never eat it.</p>



<h4> THE REFRIGERATOR</h4>



<p> <strong>Citrus fruits:</strong> Lemons and limes can be used in simple dressings and marinades and are an easy way to perk up flavors.</p>



<p> <strong>Fat-free Greek yogurt:</strong> Besides being an easy grab-and-go breakfast, you can use yogurt as a marinade for chicken or swirl it into soups and stews to add a creamy element or tone down spiciness.</p>



<p> <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> Herbs such as cilantro and basil add tons of instant flavor to simple recipes.</p>



<p> <strong>Green vegetables:</strong> Ingredients such as broccoli, zucchini, and bell peppers are a great starting place for most meals and mean a quick stir-fry is never far away.</p>



<p> <strong>Hard cheese:</strong> Hard cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Cheddar last a long time, and it only takes a little to add loads of flavor to your food.<br> Lean proteins: Quick-cooking lean proteins such as skinless chicken breast, shrimp, and eggs can be combined with other kitchen staples to create endless meal options.</p>



<p> <strong>Pizza dough:</strong> Pizza is delicious, but pizza dough can be used for so much more—bake it into rolls to go with soup, use it to make a meat pie, or turn it into cinnamon buns.</p>



<h4>THE PANTRY</h4>



<p> <strong>Canned tomatoes: </strong>Canned no-salt-added tomatoes are great in soups and stews, or for making a quick pasta sauce. I prefer fire-roasted varieties, which also add a subtle smoky element.</p>



<p> <strong>Dried herbs and spices: </strong>Pick one or two of your favorite international flavor profiles and stock up.<br> Having a variety of dried herbs and spices means you can make anything from Indian curries to Italian soups, even when fresh are not available.</p>



<p> <strong>Garlic and onions:</strong> Almost every recipe I make starts with at least one of these ingredients. I stock up every time I go to the grocery store.</p>



<p> <strong>Stock: </strong>I usually have homemade chicken and vegetable stock (see here and here) in my freezer, but I always keep a few cartons of low-sodium stock in the cabinet as backup. Use it to make a quick soup or add extra flavor to a pot of whole grains.</p>



<p> <strong>Whole grains:</strong> Rice, farro, and quinoa can form the base for many meals. Each has its own unique flavor, so I always have a good variety on hand to choose from.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Managing tasks in life and shaping a new Lifestyle to meet your desires and aspirations will require 4 elements to be recognized, understood, and then aligned. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> To accomplish a significant transformation in your life, you must first understand some necessary information about you. Recognizing your life management skills requires a conscious look at the fundamental aspects of your habits. Your way of thinking, feeling, eating, and exercising is adaptable.</p>



<p> It can be modified to obtain completely different results than those you have experienced thus far.</p>



<p> Managing tasks in life and shaping a new Lifestyle to meet your desires and aspirations will require 4 elements to be recognized, understood, and then aligned. The goal is to synchronize Your MIND, EMOTIONS, FOOD, and Exercise in a way that best serves you.</p>



<p> Trust that at this present moment, you are at the right place getting the correct information at the precise time.</p>



<h3> Habits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reading.jpg" alt="reading" class="wp-image-1092"/></figure></div>



<p> A habit is any action you do many times without consciously thinking about it; it&#8217;s automatic. When you brush your teeth, you don&#8217;t think about doing it; you do it. Your brain already knows what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. And, it knows because you have done it for many years; therefore, embedded in your mind. Hence, changing your habits requires motivation, patience, discipline, and consistency.</p>



<p> Creating new healthy habits teaches the brain a new way of doing something. In doing so, the risk of returning to old habits remains since they do not require effort or motivation at execution. They stay in the brain for easy access. Your habits dictate everything you do in your day. So, get ready to stay committed and take action changing old non-working habits to a better way to live.</p>



<p> Healthy habits are beneficial because they influence many aspects of our life, such as health, work, family, and even your social life.</p>



<p> Some examples of healthy habits Include:</p>



<ul><li> Meditating</li><li> Drinking water / Staying Hydrated</li><li> Reading</li><li> Talking Positive about others</li><li> Exercising</li><li> Brushing your Teeth / Bathing</li><li> Spending Quality Time with Friends/Family</li><li> Sleeping 7 to 8 hours daily</li><li> Making your bed every morning</li><li> Being Grateful</li><li> Donating your Time to Help Others</li><li> Respecting People’s opinions</li><li> Smiling to Strangers</li><li> Organizing &amp; Cleaning your space</li></ul>



<p> Make a list of your healthy habits. Recognizing what works in your life is essential so you may do more of it. Take a moment to review your top 5 healthy habits on your list and write next to them the corresponding feelings or emotions.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>For Instance: If you have a habit of donating your time to help others, you may feel fortunate and happy because you make a positive impact on others. Doing more of the same will always bring pleasant feelings and emotions to your life.</em></p>



<p> Some unhealthy habits that can negatively affect you include:</p>



<ul><li> Thinking Negatively</li><li> Eating the wrong foods</li><li> Oversleeping / Not sleeping Required Amount</li><li> Consuming alcoholic beverages in excess</li><li> Smoking / Using Drugs</li><li> Spending hours watching television</li><li> Not Caring for you properly (i.e., excessive eating)</li><li> Watching Bad News on TV</li><li> Complaining in General (Weather, Traffic, People)</li><li> Putting other people or yourself down</li><li> Screaming or Interrupting others</li></ul>



<p> Now, make a list of your unhealthy habits. Bringing them to light empowers you to take action to change them.</p>



<p> Take a moment to review your top 5 unhealthy habits on your list and write next to the feelings or emotions you experience.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>For Instance, If you are in the habit of watching bad news on TV before you go to bed, this unhealthy habit creates anxiety, nervousness, stress and triggers unsafe feelings. If you cannot reach a deep sleep or have a full night rest, begin by changing this habit.</em></p>



<p> Make it a habit to recognize what you are doing well in your life and create more of it.</p>



<h3> Taking Action</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/take-action.png" alt="take action" class="wp-image-1093"/></figure></div>



<p> Taking action is powerful; it transforms your life. Courage and focus are required to move your plans forward. Simple daily tasks such as getting out of bed on time and making yourself a nutritious breakfast can become an overwhelming task if your habits point in the opposite direction.</p>



<p> More ambitious goals require you to leave your comfort zone. To take action, especially if you are afraid of the unfamiliar, feeling uncomfortable can be a big enough obstacle to discourage you.</p>



<p> The great news is that there is light on the other side. Once you manage to break any ambitious goal into small steps, you make progress completing one task at a time until reaching full completion.</p>



<p> You will also be more confident in yourself and have the ability to get tasks accomplished.<br> Additionally, you will enjoy and reap the benefit of positive results just because you took action. Every action you take moves you forward and shapes your future to be better and brighter. Taking small steps to reach bigger goals will bring into line your true desires for a Better <strong>Lifestyle</strong>.</p>



<h3>Pass It On!</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sharing-and-generosity.jpg" alt="sharing and generosity" class="wp-image-1094"/></figure></div>



<p> &#8220;To the extent that you have given, it’s the measure in which you shall receive.&#8221;</p>



<p> Sharing is an actual act of generosity. Being kind and generous with anything you possess, including knowledge, emotions, information, or material things can help someone improve their lives.</p>



<p> There is always something to share with others; as you do, you abandon selfishness, and life takes on a different meaning. Giving creates space for receiving more of the same or better.</p>



<p> As you acquire knowledge and discover new ways to live a meaningful, successful, and productive life, share it with everybody. Sharing and passing on information is a substantial value to have as part of your new <strong>Lifestyle</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bare-kitchen.jpg" alt="my kitchen" class="wp-image-1089"/></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;The kitchen is the most dynamic area of the House, it is the place that converges more smells, tastes, textures and elements that draw attention to the user and his guests.&#8221;</p>



<p> According to the paragraphs above, you can see that it is very important to have a kitchen in the House; much better if it is a small one. Below, we&#8217;ll see why it is vital to have it in the house, especially if it is small.</p>



<h3> 1 &#8211; It is a meeting point</h3>



<p> The kitchen is a meeting point for family gatherings and, in addition, space where you can explore your passion for food and its preparation.</p>



<p> Many tasks of the day are hung in the fridge; the important dates are hanging there too. In the fridge also are placed notes or diets, and calendar… Let&#8217;s say that the fridge is our daily task monitor. The kitchen is a meeting point; it is the area where everyone can find the other. If you have something important to say to someone you&#8217;ll do it in the kitchen.</p>



<p> If you imagine your House as a large company, consider your kitchen as the office of the Chef. It is a place where the most important decisions are made by talking and conversing. It is also a place where the most important thing of the day and of the organism is prepared: Food</p>



<h3> 2 &#8211; Create harmony in the family</h3>



<p> It is understood that in the kitchen, appeals to all the senses are created &#8211; topics of conversation that probably do not arise in other areas of the House.</p>



<p> Though the residence is spacious, the kitchen is an integrated area of greater use (family living) and to the rooms. Everything works in an integrated manner and is oriented towards the garden, allowing communication between different areas. The kitchen is designed as a social space where harmony is created in the family.</p>



<p> A kitchen should be one in which the design does not interfere with the sensory experience that produces what is prepared in it. Its ultimate goal is to convert an everyday and necessary task in a pleasant and social experience.</p>



<h2>Some Reasons Why You Must Have A Kitchen In The House</h2>



<h4> Reason #1: More space and more happiness</h4>



<p> Let’s imagine that you want to put a kitchen but you do not have much space. The built-in kitchen is the best option. The same sentence says it and there is not much more to explain: you can have all the elements of the kitchen lined up on a single wall, i.e. incorporated as if they were a single body. The first and obvious advantage that comes to mind is the one that has been mentioned: space.</p>



<p> To have everything together, small departments with many places, even to put a beautiful breakfast room somewhere in the traditional method, which had been occupied. Some designers go beyond and hide the kitchen behind doors, so the spectrum of the atmosphere changes completely and can be used as a second living room in case you organize, for example, a party.</p>



<h4> Reason #2: More comfort than we think</h4>



<p> Let’s take, for example, the case of the built-in kitchen. There are those who think that the kitchen can generate problems. On the contrary, today built-in kitchens come in all sizes and can be adapted to any type of wall. The built-in kitchen can be much more generous than you ever imagined. With the addition of the cupboard in the same space as the oven and the counter you save a huge amount of space and time in case you have to organize utensils.</p>



<h2>Benefits of A Minimal Kitchen</h2>



<p> It is always good to debug until you only have the utensils you really use and some extra things (but not too many) because doing so, there are more benefits for you.</p>



<h4>Cleaning is easy</h4>



<p> The surfaces are almost always free, so simply pass a cloth to remove the dust or any stain. So, when you have a few dishes and cutlery, it is practically impossible to leave them unwashed. In case you want to eat again, just wash the dishes you used before, simply because there are no more (except those that you have for visitors, but those are kept separately).</p>



<h4>Cooking is very comfortable</h4>



<p> There is nothing like cooking over a clear and clean area. By having few things, cooking becomes simpler and enjoyable; unhindered and with plenty of room to maneuver.</p>



<h4>Everything is reachable</h4>



<p> The drawers and the cupboards are arranged in such a way that it is very easy to find anything that you need. The utensils and ingredients are always handy.</p>



<h4>Less Tupperware = Less rotten food</h4>



<p> When you have few Tupperware, it becomes mandatory to review what are being used. If you want to store something and you do not have any free Tupperware, it is likely that they are busy keeping old food. In this way, you force yourself to rotate them and avoid filling the refrigerator with inedible stuffs.</p>



<h4>Less expired things</h4>



<p> You know exactly what you have in the refrigerator and in the cupboard.<br> You’ll never have to buy too much food but constantly checking what you have left. This helps you to have more order and avoid accumulating old food.</p>



<h4>You want to cook healthy</h4>



<p> In a saturated and dirty kitchen you do not want to prepare anything healthy, on the contrary, what you prefer is to eat anything quick and easy. On the other hand, a clean and tidy kitchen motivates you to prepare fresh and healthy foods.</p>



<h4>Inspire to have it beautiful</h4>



<p> Order calls to order and beauty calls to beauty. Love your kitchen very much and make sure to have it always clean and tidy. Never leave dirty things lying around carelessly, simply because you like to see your kitchen neat and beautiful. This translates into peace of mind and a happy home and by extension, a healthy life.</p>



<p> It is important to remember that everyone should have their kitchen (and their house) as it works best for them. This means, with more or less things according to the style and taste of each one.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchen-To-Share.jpg" alt="kitchen To Share" class="wp-image-1086"/></figure></div>



<p> Living together with colleagues in the apartment can leave you with some hobbies such as not being able to stand the silence of an empty place, but also valuable teachings. You have to be very supportive of the customs, manners, and laziness of people.</p>



<p> If you are about to share your kitchen, you should try to make peace between you and your roommates. Therefore, not only will you have to maintain that relationship with them, but you will also need to take care of and maintain your minimalist style. In this chapter, you will find tips on how to make that possible.</p>



<h3>Tip #1: Divide the refrigerator and you will win</h3>



<p> When different people live in a house, the tastes are different. Maybe the refrigerator is always full of beers, or other things that perhaps you don’t really like. In case there is only one refrigerator, the best thing you can do is that each person has their own shelf. Also, it is better not to make everyone buy stuffs the same day. Doing so, the refrigerator and the pantry get stuck. You have to coordinate the days of purchase of each one.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Place your food in the fridge strategically</h3>



<p> The food that you leave near the refrigerator door is the one that finishes first. It is better to put it behind, but be careful that it will not be forgotten or it will be spoiled.</p>



<h3>Tip #3: Reach an agreement to consume only one type of milk</h3>



<p> Unless one is lactose intolerant, another vegan and one more prefers chocolate. It is better to have only one type of milk for everyone. Products like salt, sugar, and oil also work and less mess is made.</p>



<h3>Tip #4: Do not be afraid to throw out the outdated, even if it&#8217;s alien</h3>



<p> If you see a yogurt that is going to expire, it is best that you eat it, notify the owner and replenish it. If you detect that something has already broken down, throw it away. You do not even have to notice it; they forgot it for a reason.</p>



<h3>Tip #5: Wash that dirty rate from days ago; it does not matter if it&#8217;s from another</h3>



<p> Unwashed dishes create a mess and can be an important point of conflict. It is better everyone washes his dishes and there is no major problem. If you find something small like a glass or a spoon, nothing happens if you wash it. But if a person tends to leave what he uses without washing, it is best to talk to him about that.</p>



<h3>Tip #6: Hire a cleaning professional and divide the rate</h3>



<p> Using these services once or twice a week is the best and the payment is divided among all. In truth that makes things much simpler.</p>



<h3>Tip #7: Take turns to take out the organic trash</h3>



<p> There are many people who do not know how to separate trash and it is very important to have this skill. The best thing is to take the trash religiously on Saturday or another day. And, you have to make turns because nobody wants to take care of the organic trash. This is because it smells the worst and drips.</p>



<h4>How To Move Your Kitchen In The Fastest And Most Save Way?</h4>



<p> If you live in a rental and you are young, then changes are usually part of your life: moving to new countries, new jobs, and therefore, new floors are treaded on every day. So this is surely neither the first nor the last time.</p>



<p> Therefore, you can develop techniques or strategies to make this process less tedious, much more practical, quick and organized and make sure that you only take the essentials home to your kitchen.</p>



<h4>What Comes Before The Move?</h4>



<p> As you know a long time ago that you are going to move to your new apartment, you can begin a strong and complete declutter process.<br> It takes a couple of days trying to plan where your things will be located in<br> the new apartment. This is useful for two reasons.</p>



<ol><li>The first is that it allows you to plan now the flow of the move (what to take first and what to take later).</li><li>The second is that it helps you to practice the famous minimalist question: do I have a space to store it? If there is no space for something, then that something should not reach the new apartment.</li></ol>



<h4>Techniques For Moving Faster And Safer Way</h4>



<p> <strong>Technique #1: Make a list of your future needs</strong><br> Think about the needs that you will have in your new home: do you go to a smaller or larger house? In the city or in a town? Do you have exit to the outside or terrace? Is the weather warmer or cooler? Wet or dry? All this will help you to understand what kind of things you will need to take with you and which ones definitely should be left behind. Despite being a minimalist style, a kitchen consists of a number of different individual modules, countertops, accessories, and equipment.</p>



<p> For example, is the furniture in your old kitchen kept in good condition?<br> Calculate the costs of dismantling, transport, accessories (in most cases you have to change the countertops), assembly and possible installation work and wiring. In short, value the costs and risks of maintaining your old kitchen.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #2: Prepare this area in three parts: recycling, reuse and moving</strong><br> Especially clear this area to deposit objects that you neither need nor use for anything (recycling), those that you do not need but still have utility (reuse) and those that you need and you will take to your next home (move).</p>



<p><strong> Technique #3: Divide your objects by categories</strong><br> If you start to select objects without a specific order you will get tired and discouraged very quickly. To make this process more organized you can use a checklist (mentioned in technique #1).</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #4: Begin to select</strong><br> Select the items in the first category of the checklist in each of the three parts of the kitchen area (recycling, reuse, and removal). Then go to the next category, and the next, and the next to finish with the checklist. This is the first filter for a kitchen only with what is necessary and what you most want, so do not be sorry. Allow only items with these characteristics into your life and everything will be to your advantage: a minimalist kitchen from the beginning, less weight to carry and move, more space and order, etc.</p>



<p> We recommend making a list of pending and schedule pre-move tasks:</p>



<ul><li> Sort belongings</li><li> Organize what you will take.</li><li> Take recycling to the collection center.</li><li> Save what you are going to keep.</li><li> What should be left before the day of moving.</li><li> What to do on the day of the move</li></ul>



<p><strong>Technique #5: Recycle</strong><br> Gather all the objects in the recycling area and remember the infallible trick for your minimalist cleaning. Recycle your discarded belongings as soon as possible.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #6: Reuse</strong><br> Donate, give away or resell everything that is in good condition and may be needed by others. If you think there is something that can be useful to the next tenant (open cleaning products, brooms or mops, kitchen utensils), give it to him and write him a note so he knows he can use them.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #7: Start packing</strong><br> Pack by categories leaving out only what is necessary for the last days. Do not buy new boxes to keep. Sure, what you have at home already serves you (suitcases, large reusable shopping bags, plastic storage boxes, baskets, etc.).<br> Finally, do not forget to label the boxes so you will know where you have everything and it will be easier to find a specific item when you arrive at your new home.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #8: Organize in boxes what you are going to keep</strong><br> Prepare to save what you will keep and separate in boxes by priorities:</p>



<ul><li> <strong>High</strong>: What is very necessary and functional</li><li> <strong>Media</strong>: What you would like to unpack soon but which is not necessary.</li><li> <strong>Low</strong>: What is decorative</li></ul>



<p>This will allow you to unpack more peacefully and without haste.</p>



<p> <strong>Advice: Systematize the move</strong></p>



<ul><li> To make everything easier, differentiate the boxes.</li><li> Write down the space they belong to.</li><li> Assign a number by priority (1 is the highest priority).</li></ul>



<p> This way, once you arrive at your new home, you can take the boxes to their respective spaces and open only those that has the number 1 marked. Little by little you can open the others.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #9: And the day arrives! Organize your move</strong><br> If you have a moving service, congratulations! And if not, you have to load.<br> If you have an elevator, congratulations again! And if not, you have to load up the stairs (if any). To make everything more bearable, ask for help from friends and family and reward them with a good meal (after all who wouldn’t settle for a good meal?). In addition, this will help you to establish an organization system: first the largest furniture, then the small ones together with boxes and suitcases, and finally small objects to fill in the gaps.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #10: When everything is ready to go, clean</strong><br> When the van is full and the house empty, take advantage and do a good general cleaning. Nobody likes to find a dirty house, and although it sounds a bit weird. It will be good for you to spend some time alone with the house, say goodbye and think about this new stage in which you are embarking.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #11: When you get to your new home, do not unpack anything</strong><br> Yes, we know that this is the opposite of what is always said: it is important to unpack and place as soon as possible to get rid of it and continue with our lives. But, maybe not. Unpack little by little only what you need and miss and leave the rest untouched for up to a month. What you did not get out after that time, you probably do not need it.</p>

<p> We all use one knife or two on a regular basis either for their shape or grip without using the other knives.&nbsp;The idea&nbsp;is to keep a few knives, and&nbsp;replace them with another whenever needed instead of collecting a multi-kit do we don&#8217;t need.

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h3><strong> 13. Specific Pitchers or Peelers of Fruits</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1453" width="452" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg 602w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></figure></div>



<p>These items don&#8217;t deserve to be found in the kitchen to be used seasonally or for rare occasions. You will not remember that you have them when you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>12. Over 18 Molds for Cupcakes or Muffins</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1452" width="563" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></figure></div>



<p> We don&#8217;t have to collect all shapes of molds, we need just one or two beautiful shapes because cupcakes or muffins is what matters to us at the end. You have not put a cake shop.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 11. Wok</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Wok.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1164" width="563" height="319"/></figure></div>



<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need it to prepare satisfying oriental dishes. Unless you want to learn Chinese cooking, give it to the family that needs it or throw it out the window.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>10. Ice Cream Machine</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ice-Cream-Machine.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1165" width="563" height="373"/><figcaption>yourbestdigs.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It&#8217;s not worth the investment if you do not regularly make homemade ice cream. It is very little minimalist to have one.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 9. A Coffee Grinder or Spice Grinder</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1456" width="473" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg 630w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure></div>



<p>So, unless you use the grinder on a daily basis, it is best to simply buy quality pre-ground spices in small quantities so that they stay fresh and ready for your best dishes anytime you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>8. Cloths and Deteriorated Mittens</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Deteriorated-Mittens.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1167" width="563" height="321"/></figure></div>



<p>Usually at the bottom in the drawer accumulate the oldest rags, with some broken or impossible to remove. If you pull the ones that are on the top, it&#8217;s time to dig up the bottom ones and throw them away. Take advantage and check the mittens: if they are burned, say goodbye.<br> &#8220;It&#8217;s better to have 5 cloths in conditions that dry well than two dozen historic clothes,&#8221; says Gallay.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. As we saw in the previous chapter, the maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. The maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. i.e., what is essential is to have few things but each one performs its function perfectly.</p>



<p> For this reason, we will see a unique kitchen set up ideas to design your minimalist kitchen to create space.</p>



<h4>Idea #1: Everything in its place</h4>



<p> In the minimalist style, each item occupies a certain position that is defined by its functionality. In a style that less is more, simplicity is the key to its appeal.</p>



<h4>Idea #2: Attention to details</h4>



<p> The minimalist aesthetic can be present in any detail and if not, look at this spectacular staircase in the image below. Its simplicity, lighting, and design leaves no space for doubt. It is a perfect minimalist example.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/staircase.jpg" alt="staircase" class="wp-image-1077"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #3: Kitchen modern minimalist vintage</h4>



<p> For most modern interior or minimalist you can decant lacquered furniture that has a glossy or Matt finish. You can combine this color with accessories in aluminum or steel finishes, resulting to a modern outlook.</p>



<p> The walls can also be plain white, because you may have a smooth or tile wall. On the ceiling is also white is a good choice although it should be avoided in the floor. For these, it is best to use white but with touches of gray or sand colors.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-modern-minimalist-vintage.jpg" alt="Kitchen modern minimalist vintage" class="wp-image-1078"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #4: Ingenious solution</h4>



<p> When it comes to minimizing the presence of furniture and various appliances, relying on multifunctional elements can be a perfect solution. A piece of furniture acts as a bookstore, support for the television and improvised dividing wall of the entrance. What more could you want?</p>



<h4>Idea #5: Set of contrasts</h4>



<p> Not everything in minimalism should be clear white. Although the background color is important, you can combine it with grey or black resulting in spaces full of pure class and elegance.</p>



<h4>Idea #6: Kitchen in L</h4>



<p> Regardless of the actual size of your kitchen, if you adopt a minimalist style, this will help you to manage that space and make it look even broader. If you also like L design, you will earn meters for the circulation within it.</p>



<h4>Idea #7: materials</h4>



<p> Far from what it may seem, the minimalist style has nothing of aseptic or cold. Indeed, the interiors that are committed to this trend often introduce materials that provide warmth, such as the wood.</p>



<h4>Idea #8: Functional kitchen</h4>



<p> The details are great allies of the minimalist style. Why? The answer is simple. It’s a trend of little prone to recharging spaces, the existence of nuances is essential to create spaces full of qualities. In this case, incorporate one of these details as a counter, a practical bar for a functional space and style.</p>



<h4>Idea #9: Colonize the walls</h4>



<p> An alternative to the incorporation of the furnishings is that you can take advantage of the possibilities offered by the walls of your home. Place shelves do not have reasons to be overloaded. This allows you to embrace the minimalist style.</p>



<p>Idea #10: High ceilings</p>



<p> The high ceilings and loft-style homes are ideal for decorating with minimalist style scenarios. The amplitude at the height of this type of construction is a delight in creating unique spaces that is beautiful to behold.</p>



<h4>Idea #11: Save space in the Hall</h4>



<p> Often we tend to waste Hall space but it is a very valuable and useful meters. You can use the space for a series of cabinets which, though unnoticed, will give you great service.</p>



<h4>Idea #12: Mileage counters</h4>



<p> Counters are increasingly becoming quite common in kitchen designs. Not only in minimal spaces but also in any style. These type of elements are particularly useful not only in functionality but also for its marked aesthetic component.</p>



<h4>Idea #13: All-in-one</h4>



<p> Even if you don&#8217;t have space problems, minimalism is a style ideal to solve the home décor. This kitchen does not sacrifice a single centimeter by incorporating the necessary furniture, simplicity is the key to its appeal. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-All-in-one.jpg" alt="Kitchen All-in-one" class="wp-image-1079"/></figure></div>



<p> Anyway, remember that any space in your home is susceptible to succumb to the minimalist style and kitchen full of charm. All you have to do is just to visualize and decorate! </p>



<h2><strong>Now, How Should Your Minimalist Kitchen Be?</strong></h2>



<p> In the kitchen, it is common to accumulate accessories and decorations, some more useful than others. However, through minimalism, the tendency now is to achieve functional and sober kitchen environment that gives the sensation of order and harmony. Below, we are going to outline some characteristics that you can consider for your minimalist kitchen.</p>



<h4>Feature #1: Utility and practicality</h4>



<p> One of the first characteristics of a minimalist kitchen is the functionality. All kitchens must have an area of work where to cut, chop, whip and clean to make the task more efficient. This is why keeping a clear countertop is the first step to follow.</p>



<h4>Feature #2: Covered and stored appliances</h4>



<p> Some appliances that are not used on a daily basis such as grinder or Blender must be stored inside a cupboard so they are not in sight. The same goes with utensils and cutlery, which must be saved, but in an accessible place, for practical use of them when it comes to cooking and eating.</p>



<h4>Feature #3: Housekeeping</h4>



<p> Cleaning after every meal is essential for the provision of a neat and harmonious appearance. This detail will not only allow you to have a more minimalist space but also present you and your family comfort in your home.</p>



<h4>Feature #4: uncluttered space (for small spaces)</h4>



<p> To get the feeling of harmony and order it is important to have uncluttered spaces, no objects in the middle, especially if you do not have a large space. In addition, you must opt for simple geometries of straight lines in countertops, Islands, and cupboards.</p>



<h4>Feature #5: The colors of minimalism</h4>



<p> White is the color par excellence of the minimalism that gives an excellent result. In chairs, high or worktops of granite you can look for contrast and create harmony in the space. For example, you can combine white with grey and black. Also, the white floor and utensils in this tone, are the best choice to give light and beautiful ambience to the room.</p>



<p> Avoid colors like yellow, Orange and Brown.</p>



<h4>Feature #6: The cupboard</h4>



<p> The cupboards should be large and of practical design to keep all the utensils and cutlery neatly in place. It is common to finish with a shiny lacquer and straight lines on the doors, without any adornment and in neutral tones, mainly white.</p>



<h4>Feature #7: Appliances and furniture</h4>



<p> For the sink, the oven and the refrigerator, stainless steel is the best option, and the ceramic hob can be black on a white countertop.</p>



<p> The islands are a constant of this style with white chairs without backrest or with a black metal backrest to contrast.</p>



<h2>Some Tricks For Your Minimalist Kitchen</h2>



<h4>Trick #1: Kitchen islands</h4>



<p> If we talk about things that are fashionable for kitchens, you must have that clear: the Islands. We cannot define exactly the key to its success. But, the truth is that people who test it often become unrepentant.</p>



<ul><li> Islands better distribute the space in the kitchen.</li><li> They serve as a separator between the kitchen and dining room.</li><li> They allow you to move through them in one way more simple.</li><li> The Islands can be defined spaces, superior, where the countertop provides you a great area of work, and the bottom, perfect storage space to store dishes and other kitchen utensils.</li></ul>



<h4>Trick # 2: The order</h4>



<p> If there is something that attracts people to minimalism, it is precisely the sense of order that it gives to the kitchen. In the minimalist kitchen, there should be an almost total absence of accessories and furniture without handles.</p>



<h4>Trick # 3: Lighting</h4>



<p> The lights integrated into the furniture are a great success and if you decide to put them in your kitchen you will surely love the result. It facilitates the search for kitchen tools and also illuminates the rest of the room with charm and elegance.</p>



<p> With regard to lighting, it is very important in minimalist kitchens. A good combination of colors favor the lighting of the space. Strengthen the entrance of external light and think well about the distribution of the furniture so that they do not hinder its entrance. The cupboards with transparent doors for the tableware are perfect the most of spaces. Lighting should be white and modern light.</p>

<p><em>You don&#8217;t get anything clean without getting something else dirty. Cecil Baxter</em></p>



<h2>Sanitize the Baby Highchairs &amp; Booster Seats</h2>



<p> If you have a dishwasher, you can place the tray directly in the washer but make sure the washing cycle can reach a minimum of 16o° Fahrenheit.</p>



<p> You can also use dishwashing liquid and warm water to clean the entire chair. Use a wet wipe, a swab dipped in mouthwash that contains alcohol, and length of dental floss to clean the gunk from all of the nooks and crannies.</p>



<p> Every few days, wipe the chair with hydrogen peroxide which is a natural disinfectant that will kill the germs but won’t leave a residue behind. Do a deep cleaning weekly.</p>



<h2> Clean the Table &amp; Chairs</h2>



<p> If your table is wood, use a wood cleaner (see the recipe). Clean and polish the dining room table, chairs, and other articles of furniture. Be sure to check underneath the seats. You might need to use a whisk brook to remove some spider webs. You can also use dishwashing liquid and warm water to clean the entire chair.</p>



<h2> Gently Clean the Chandelier</h2>



<p> If you have a simple pattern; just dust the fixture and light bulbs with an inexpensive paintbrush. It will make the room brighter, and you won’t see any webs when it isn’t Halloween. If you have one of the types with all of the pretty glass bangles, use this method:</p>



<p> It is best to turn the circuit breaker off in the room where the fixture is located. If it is not possible, be sure to cover the switch plate to ensure the light won’t be turned on while you’re cleaning.</p>



<p> Place a blanket or tarp under the chandelier before you begin to catch the dust and (hopefully) break the fall if you drop a fragile piece of the glass.</p>



<p> Use a solution of 3 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar, and mix into a spray bottle. Spray a lint-free cloth with the solution and wipe down the spindle and arms of the chandelier. Use a dry lint-free cloth to buff it dry.</p>



<p> Clean the prisms using a vinegar/water solution sprayed on a cloth. Wear a pair of white/cotton gloves, so you don’t leave any smudges. You can purchase the gloves at a thrift shop for a minimal fee or online.</p>



<p> Tip: As you are cleaning the chandelier, be sure to lay out the prisms in a pattern, so you understand which way to place them back on the frame.</p>



<p> Remove all items from the cabinet and clean it. Use some of the wood cleaner to refresh the surface, naturally.</p>



<p> Take just five minutes to do a quick run in the china cabinet. You might be surprised what you end up with in your box of questionable items. Quickly, consider items you can easily part with and place them into a keep—toss— donate stack. Don’t be tempted to put it in the attic! Save the heirloom pieces and consider consigning, donating, or gifting the items.</p>



<p> It depends on how much silver you have, whether you clean it for now or wait until you have spare time in your schedule.</p>



<h2>Clean the Curtains</h2>



<p> Vacuum the curtains using the upholstery attachment. A quick once over should do the trick to remove most of the dust. If they look clean after the vacuum, you can use a lint roller later if a touchup is needed.</p>



<p> You have several options for thorough cleaning. You can use the delicate cycle on your washing machine or hand-wash the curtains. It will depend on the sturdiness, quality, as well as the material of the fabric. Check the labels before you proceed.</p>

<p> If you have a toddler and you think your kitchen is clean, all you need to do is turn around a few times, and your baby has probably found a way to find a new distraction causing another messy cleanup.</p>



<p> Let’s take a look at the kitchen cleaning methods and clean from the countertops to the kitchen floor.</p>



<h2> The Kitchen Sink:</h2>



<p> It’s time to tackle the kitchen sink. Just because you wash out the sink daily after you do a load of dishes, doesn’t mean it is clean. Water spots, rust, soap scum, and food stains can build up if you don’t stay ahead of them.</p>



<p> <strong>Porcelain Sinks:</strong> If you have a porcelain sink, you can make it gleam with this process:</p>



<ul><li>Line the sink with paper towels.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Soak them with bleach.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Let them soak for 30 minutes, and discard them.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Rinse the sink with hot running water.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Note</strong>: Don’t use bleach on colored porcelain because it will fade. Instead, use vinegar, baking soda, or a mild detergent (and a bit of elbow grease).</p>



<p> Now that you have the sink clean, you can protect it from scratches and stains by installing a plastic mat on the bottom of the sink. The mat will protect the shiny sink from lingering acidic foods/liquids such as salad dressing, vinegar, and fruit.</p>



<p><strong> The Garbage Disposal</strong>: If you smell something that seems rancid, it could be the garbage disposal needs some cleaning also. Simply, grind a few lemons in the unit to make it fresh and clean. Repeat the process every few weeks. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the drain for several hours before running the disposal. For a deeper clean, use this method for the garbage disposal drain:<br> What You Need:</p>



<p> ● White Vinegar (1 Cup)<br> ● Baking Soda (.5 cup)<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>The mixture will fizz (remember pop rocks candy from the 1970s) with a popping noise.</li><li>Wait a few minutes.</li><li>Pour boiling water down the drain.</li><li>Fill the drain with 2 cups of ice.</li><li>Pour one cup of salt in the drain over the ice cubes (rock salt or sea salt is a good choice if you have it).</li><li>Turn the cold-water faucet to the on position.</li><li>Turn on the disposal unit.</li><li>Run the disposal until the ice is gone.</li><li>The grime and debris should be loosened. Cut a lime or lemon in half and let the disposal chew them up for a deodorized drain.</li></ul>



<h2> Sanitizing the Sponges</h2>



<p> You can sanitize your sponge by tossing it into the microwave for ten to twenty seconds. It will kill all of the bacterial germs hiding in the nooks and crannies! Let them air dry thoroughly. Make an attempt to replace them every two weeks.</p>



<h2> Clean Small Appliances</h2>



<p> ● <strong>Toasters</strong>: Remove the crumbs from the toaster and toaster oven. Clean the racks with hot, soapy water to remove any food debris.<br> ● <strong>Can Opener</strong>: Take the opener apart and clean the cutter by soaking it in hot, soapy water. Scrub the blade with a scouring pad if necessary. Be careful, so you don’t get cut on the sharp blade.<br> ● <strong>The Blender</strong>: If you have ever tried to clean a blender, you know how involved the process can become. Simply add some soapy water in the blender, blend, rinse, and dry — no more hands on the sharp blades, or first aid kits necessary for the job.<br> ● Wipe all surfaces of the other small appliances.</p>



<h2>Clean the Microwave</h2>



<p> Remove any trays and wash them in hot, soapy water. Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe and scrub the entire unit. Be sure to spray the cleaner on the rag or sponge; not directly in the microwave.</p>



<p> You can also go the natural route with a few sliced lemons and a bowl of water in the microwave. Turn the unit on high until the microwave is steamy.<br> Let it steep for a few minutes to cut through the grease and grime. You can easily wipe out the moisture, and replace it with a fresh smelling space.</p>



<h2> Clean the Refrigerator</h2>



<p> Begin at the top of the refrigerator and remove everything. Clean out each shelf as you proceed. If any of the drawers or shelves are removable, take each unit out, and use warm soapy water to clean it. You want to clean every surface, especially the ones on the door—inside and out.</p>



<p> Before placing your food back inside of the fridge, line the shelves with some parchment paper or plastic food wrap to make cleaning a breeze. If you have a small mess, just remove the layer of plastic, and it is clean!</p>



<h2> Super-Clean the Oven</h2>



<p> Use natural products to clean the oven manually. You can choose from several techniques for general cleaning of your oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 1:</strong> Simply apply a layer of baking soda and spray it with a vinegar solution. It should form a paste. Leave the mixture on the surface of the oven for five minutes. Wipe the oven with a damp rag or sponge.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 2:</strong> First, take a look at one of the general natural cleaning options using baking soda:<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda<br> ● Water<br> ● Spray bottle<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Begin by spraying the oven with water, so it’s damp.</li><li>Sprinkle a ¼-inch layer of the soda, making sure you cover the entire surface.</li><li>If you see a dry spot, respray it with the water.</li><li>Let the mixture rest for at least three to four hours with the oven OFF.</li><li>Wipe the paste with an old towel to remove the grime.</li><li>It could take several applications, but thank goodness, it is natural.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 3:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, this will help remove the stuck-on grease and food.<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda (3 tbsp.)<br> ● Warm water (1 cup)<br> ● Castile soap (1 tbsp.)<br> Variations:<br> ● Lemon &amp; Clove: Add 5 drops each.<br> ● Lemon: Add 10 drops essential oil<br> ● Lemon &amp; Rosemary: Add 5 drops of each oil.<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Add all of the ingredients into a spray bottle. Shake well to mix.</li><li>To Use: Spray the oven liberally and let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li><li>Wipe it clean with a cloth or sponge. Rinse and let it air dry.</li><li>To Store: Store the leftovers for up to two weeks. Shake to<br> combine before using.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Manual Cleaning Ovens:</strong> <strong>Not Kid-Friendly:</strong> For tougher stains, you can use a commercial oven cleaner. You can also use a ½ cup of household ammonia.<br> Place the ammonia in a shallow pottery/glass container in the cold oven overnight. The burned-on food and grease will become loosened from the ammonia fumes.</p>



<p> Note: Don’t turn on the oven while the ammonia is inside of the oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Self-Cleaning Ovens:</strong> You are fortunate if you have a self-cleaning oven, but it also makes a mess with the ash left behind &#8211; similar to cigarette ashes. Clean up is simply wiping the ashes off the surfaces. If you don’t want to spend the extra time (anywhere from one to three hours) with an oven pumped up to 880 degrees; there is another way to clean those pesky spills.</p>



<p> <strong>Steam Cleaning Method: </strong>Choose the steam cleaning cycle which takes about 30 minutes.</p>



<ul><li>All you need to do is place one cup of water on the bottom of a cool oven.</li><li>Close the door and click the Steam Clean Cycle.</li></ul>



<p> The door won’t automatically lock, and it doesn’t involve any harsh chemicals. You also clean the racks while still in the oven. Wipe up the moisture and food debris and you are done!</p>



<p> <strong>Additional Helpful Usage Oven Tips:</strong></p>



<p> ● Never use commercial oven cleaners or liners of any type in or around any part of your self-cleaning oven.<br> ● Don’t use aluminum foil to catch any spillage.<br> ● Depending on the model the racks and pans might need to be removed. (Stainless steel must be removed.)</p>



<h2>Countertops &amp; The Backsplash</h2>



<p> Remove everything from the counters and thoroughly wipe down all of the surfaces using an all-purpose cleaner. Don’t forget the backsplash; it needs a good scrubbing also.</p>



<p> <strong>Special Countertops</strong><br> If you have white countertops, a cleaner with bleach included or soft-scrub (see the recipe) can be used for stubborn stains. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions, so you don’t damage the surfaces. These are the basics for four common countertops:</p>



<p> <strong>Stone Countertops: (Slate, Limestone, &amp; Soapstone):</strong><br> What You Need:<br> ● Warm, soapy water<br> ● A mild bleach solution<br> ● Or a non-abrasive cleaner</p>



<p> Note: Be sure to test a spot before you use anything other than warm, soapy water.</p>



<p> Grease Buildups: Use a mixture of white vinegar and water or an allpurpose cleaner.</p>



<p> You can also use a small brush such as a toothbrush to clean around the edges of the counters. Never use an abrasive pad because it will scratch the surface.</p>



<p> <strong>Butcher-Block Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> What You Need:</p>



<ul><li>Warm, soapy water</li><li>A mild bleach solution</li><li>A non-abrasive kitchen cleaner</li></ul>



<p> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Use a toothbrush along the edging to remove any debris.</li><li>If the surface feels tacky, use a baking soda and water paste.</li><li>Then, rinse thoroughly.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Ceramic Tile Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> You can use soap and water to clean ceramic tiles, but you need to be sure to rinse them thoroughly because soap can leave a filmy residue behind. Add some vinegar to the water to alleviate this issue. Never use an abrasive pad or cleaner.</p>



<p> Note: Even though the tile doesn’t stain easily—the grout will—with bacterial buildup as a result. Use a mild bleach solution and a toothbrush to clean the grout.</p>



<p> <strong>Concrete Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Clean the surface with warm and soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly.<br> You can use a mild bleach solution, but never use a scouring pad or abrasive cleaner on the surfaces.</p>



<p> For stubborn stains, you may also use talc mixed with a mixture of bleach, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste to the stained area, and use a soft brush to scrub the stain gently. Rinse thoroughly.</p>



<p> <strong>Marble Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Cleaning marble countertops is a bit different. It should be cleaned regularly with a soft, damp cloth (microfiber works well) to prevent streaks. Rinse it thoroughly to remove any residue. Wipe it dry because air drying can create water spots.</p>



<p> If acidic foods stain the surface such as wine, orange juice, or tomatoes; you may need to have the professionals clean the spot.</p>



<h2> The Cutting Board</h2>



<p> You have two choices to remove the leftover stains and smells on your cutting board using natural products. Use a lemon to scrub the board down.<br> You can also sprinkle some baking soda on the surface to remove some of the odors. Just rinse the board later and let it dry. You can also purchase plastic cutting boards that come in several colors for each type of food you would cut.</p>



<h2> Cabinets &#8211; Drawers &amp; Shelves</h2>



<p> Use a damp rag to clean any spills, spots, or splatters with an all-purpose cleaner. If you have wooden cabinets; use some Murphy’s Oil Soap, so the wood isn’t damaged. However, if the cabinets are new, it is best to ask the manufacturer or builder what works best on your particular cabinet.</p>



<p> <strong>Copper Pots</strong></p>



<p> Copper pots hanging in a kitchen makes it have a charming, homey effect.<br> Not only that, but it also saves a lot of space. However, you want to keep the surfaces shiny. Try one of these natural remedies that might surprise you:<br> ● <strong>Catsup</strong>: Give catsup a whirl; it will look really gross, but the acid will help cut through the tarnished surface.<br> ● <strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>: Pour some AC vinegar into a paper plate and let it soak. Rinse the pan and dry it completely.<br> ● <strong>Lemons &amp; Salt</strong>: Cut the lemon into wedges; dip a wedge into the salt, and rub the pan until it’s clean. Rinse the pan quickly and thoroughly in cold water, and wipe it dry.<br> ● <strong>Beer</strong>: Put some beer on the pot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes. Rinse and wipe it until dry and shiny.<br> ● <strong>Cottage Cheese</strong>: This is a cure that works without any scrubbing. Leave a layer of cottage cheese on the bottom for approximately five minutes. Rinse it completely and dry.</p>



<p> <strong>Stained Coffee Mugs:</strong></p>



<p> If you have stained coffee mugs, try this solution:<br> ● Also, try baking soda and water made into a paste.<br> ● This also works well on stained tea cups or coffee mugs, and even the cutting board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Well-structured-Kitchen-683x1024.jpg" alt="Well-structured Kitchen" class="wp-image-1067"/></figure></div>



<p> When you step into your kitchen, the thought of organizing it sounds tiresome and time-consuming. However, you should not look at it that way knowing very well there is a lot in store for you to benefit from with a well-structured kitchen. The main question that you need to ask is, what are you looking to organize in your kitchen? From the first glance, what is the first thing that comes to your mind that should be organized? Perhaps it’s your junk drawer, or your knives, or the appliances that aren’t well-positioned. Maybe it’s the cabinets, cookbooks, drawers, or the refrigerator and freezer. If all these need to be organized, then you need a plan.</p>



<p> The plan that you are going to use should define your starting point. It should also tell you the length of time you will need to complete the entire process.<br> This is so you don’t end up wasting time cleaning the kitchen at the expense of other rooms.</p>



<h4>Why Start With a Plan?</h4>



<p> Working with a plan is the best way to ensure that you meet your organizational goals at the end of the day. The best thing is that a plan will also help you maintain your focus on what should be done at what time. What you should understand is that there are many things that should be organized in your kitchen. Therefore, if you fail to plan, you will find yourself moving from one corner to the other feeling frustrated and worn out that everything looks messy. In fact, you could end up losing hope that your kitchen can have an organized look, just as you had initially imagined.</p>



<p> The best way of planning your kitchen organization is walking into the room and deciding what you will do in a procedural manner. The following is a practical strategy that you can adopt as a plan to organize this room in your house.</p>



<h3> Step 1 &#8211; Categorize Your Items</h3>



<p> The first step you should take is to categorize what you have in your kitchen.<br> Knowing these categories will help you position everything in its rightful place. During this step, you should take everything out of your cabinets and list them in a notebook. Move from one cabinet to the other as you conduct this procedure without ignoring anything. Remember, you are also trying to avoid clutter from filling your kitchen, so nothing should be left untouched.</p>



<p> Moreover, to save on time, you should not dwell on specifics. Try to categorize your items based on general classifications. This will make the process easier for you to handle. Depending on what you have in your kitchen, there are several categories that you will have including plates, mugs, silverware, serving dishes, pans, cooking oils, spices, food storage, pet supplies, knives, pantry, and miscellaneous items.</p>



<h3> Step 2 -Use Sticky Notes to Identify Categories</h3>



<p> Handy tools that should not be left behind are sticky notes to help with the identification process. The categories you created in the first step should be labeled using a pen and a sticky note. Give each category a unique label and place them somewhere visible.</p>



<p> After labeling all your categories, it is worth noting that there are changes you will be making concerning the position of your items. This is what organization is all about. You want to store things in places where they can easily be accessed. If some of the things are rarely used, it makes more sense to store them in cabinets that aren’t located close to your workstations.</p>



<h3> Step 3 &#8211; Identify New Locations</h3>



<p> An important step in the planning process is knowing where your items will be stored. You should have a clear plan where your new storage locations will be. It is advisable to think about this based on proximity. With the sticky notes that you had previously labeled, use them to stick in the new locations where you wish to store your things.</p>



<p> Take note that you are not moving things around in this step. This is simply part of the planning. Don’t try to move items in your kitchen just yet as you will only confuse yourself. Simply place the sticky notes on the cabinets and drawers where you wish to store your goods. The significance of this step is that it helps you to visualize how things will look around your kitchen. You can move the stickers around until you get the desired look you anticipate.</p>



<p> After you are through placing your notes in different locations, you can take the next step of organizing. The important thing is that you should not remove the notes during the entire process.</p>



<p> You can see that having a solid plan will guarantee that you find it easy to rearrange things around your kitchen. Picture a scenario where you failed to plan how you will handle the process. Certainly, you will feel overwhelmed with the clutter. You will not know where to start and what to do to make your kitchen look good. This chapter has detailed for you a practical plan that you can use to kick off the process of organizing your kitchen. The important thing to keep in mind here is that you don’t have to complicate things as this will only discourage you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchen-lightning.jpg" alt="kitchen lightning" class="wp-image-1062"/></figure></div>



<p> Kitchen lighting is just as important as having the right utensils to prepare meals. Without enough lighting, one would face some difficulties working in the kitchen. Therefore, before you conclude that you have designed your kitchen in an ideal manner, you should consider the type of lighting that you are using. With the many lighting options, you need to determine what type of lighting is best for your kitchen. You can go with task lighting, general lighting or both. What should you go for? </p>



<h2>Kitchen Lighting Ideas</h2>



<p> Before looking into the best lighting options, let’s look at how to light up the kitchen while at the same time decorating it.</p>



<h4> Layer Your Look</h4>



<p> Layers are a good option for lighting simply because there is no lighting fixture that will provide your kitchen with the required light for all kitchen tasks. This means that you will have to use one main overhead light with a combination of other smaller lights, hence the name layers.</p>



<p> The smaller lights should be positioned in areas where there are other tasks in the kitchen. For instance, you should have smaller lights near the dishwasher, food prep section and any other section that is of importance in the kitchen.<br> The significance of adding these layers is that it prevents glare in your kitchen.</p>



<h4>Add Ambience</h4>



<p> Why shouldn’t you forget about ambient lighting in your kitchen? This is one fixture that most people tend to ignore. However, it should be made clear that ambient lighting is of great importance with regard to filling the spaces or the dark areas in lighting. If the lighting fixtures that you used doesn’t light up the room as you expected, these gaps can be effectively filled by ambient lighting. It gives your kitchen a warm glow. Also, they are an affordable option if you are running on a tight budget.</p>



<h4> Reflect on Tasks</h4>



<p> Task lighting is also a fundamental part of any kitchen lighting. Just as the name suggests, this form of lighting will concentrate light on the specific tasks that you are performing. In this case, if you are preparing food in the prep section, you should have designated task lighting in that section. Also, there should be lighting fixtures in other major zones such as the washing zone and the storage zone.</p>



<h4> Add Light Dimmers</h4>



<p> You’ll want to work in a kitchen where the light is bright enough for you to see what you are preparing. However, once you are done cooking and you’re ready to eat, you also want a dim light to facilitate a warm and cool environment. This means that light dimmers are equally significant. They provide your kitchen lighting with the advantage of easier customization to suit your needs.</p>



<h4> Watch the Heights</h4>



<p> The height of your kitchen lighting should also be taken into consideration.<br> For effective lighting in your kitchen, you don’t want to hang the lights far above the kitchen counters. Likewise, they should not be too low. It is important to fix your lighting fixtures at an appropriate height. Also keep in mind the tall people in your house.</p>



<h4> Use Accents</h4>



<p> If you are looking to add depth to your kitchen, then accent kitchen lighting is the ideal choice. Besides giving your kitchen depth, it also provides dimension.</p>



<h4> Use a Wall Sconce</h4>



<p> In conjunction with adding accents, you could alternatively use a wall sconce.<br> This applies in situations where you have something important to showcase about your kitchen. For example, if you have a special wall where you hang your artwork, using wall sconces for your lighting can be an ideal way of lighting this section and brings out your kitchen personality. You should be careful not to use high-voltage lighting fixtures for this option.</p>



<h4> Fixtures in Threes</h4>



<p> Lighting up a large kitchen can be challenging if at all you don’t know the right fixtures and the lighting plan that you will be using. In this case, you might want to go for one main kitchen fixture. However, you might realize that one light fixture will leave other areas of the room without light. So the best option for you will be to use three similar lighting fixtures. Use pendant fixtures to hang at the center of your kitchen. The benefit here is that light will be effectively distributed.</p>



<h4>The Advantage of Track Lighting</h4>



<p> Another issue that you will be looking to avoid in your kitchen is shadow.<br> Shadows will only give your kitchen an inconsistent look. Therefore, there are times when you will find yourself preferring to work in particular areas.<br> This happens because some areas of your kitchen are dark. To avoid this, track lighting comes handy. The good news is that there are a wide array of options for you to choose from. The lighting fixtures are also energy efficient so you won’t spend a lot on electricity bills after renovating your kitchen.<br> The track lighting fixtures can offer a quick fix since they can be installed in a day or two.</p>



<h4> Avoid Clutter</h4>



<p> Your desire to have a bright kitchen might push you to install several main lights. Indeed, you will get sufficient light, but the issue is that your kitchen will appear cluttered. Too much light is also not good. The best thing to do is to use one or two main lights and rely on other lighting fixtures to fill the gaps. For instance, track lighting can help to provide light in the storage and other important areas of your kitchen.</p>



<h4> Open Shelf Lighting</h4>



<p> Open shelf lighting is also worth thinking over if you have open shelves in your kitchen. In most cases, these open shelves will be far from the main light. As such, you should utilize LED strip lights in this section. They could be positioned under the shelves. It will be easy for you to locate what you want in this section.</p>



<h4>The Influence of Your Kitchen Color</h4>



<p> While striving to install the best lighting fixtures for your kitchen, you shouldn’t forget to consider your kitchen color. If you have a warm-colored kitchen, it is advisable to add more brightness to this room. Therefore, you should settle for higher wattage bulbs. On the contrary, a bright kitchen will not require as much lighting since the color reflects the little light that it gets from these bulbs. A white-colored kitchen, for example, will not require high wattage bulbs.</p>



<h4> Lighting Your Dark Room</h4>



<p> There are also those spaces that are often dark. The pantry section, for instance, is one area that is sometimes left unattended. This section can be illuminated by using motion sensors. This means that you don’t have to look for the switch when entering. When you open the door, the light sensor will light up.</p>



<h2> Common Kitchen Lighting Challenges</h2>



<p> If you have worked or cooked in different kitchens, then you must have noticed a difference in lighting. Some kitchens provide sufficient light in all areas that you may want to access. However, there are those kitchens that fail to provide this. It leaves one with the challenge of having to use additional lighting to locate what they are looking for.</p>



<p> Additionally, there are instances where some kitchens don’t balance light effectively. This means that they are either too bright or too dark. The following is a brief look into these common lighting challenges that you might encounter in your kitchen and their respective solutions.</p>



<h4> Uncomfortable Lighting</h4>



<p> The lighting of your kitchen can be uncomfortable if at all it’s too dark or too bright. The problem causing this is that you don’t have layers.</p>



<p> To fix this problem, you need to balance the lighting. You should have a good balance between ambient, task, and accent lighting. What does this mean? Ambient lighting fixtures provide general lighting. Task lighting fixtures delivers the required light to perform particular tasks such as cooking, washing, etc. Accent lighting is decorative. Balance these in your kitchen and folks will not feel that your kitchen lighting is uncomfortable.</p>



<h4> You Can’t See What You’re Cooking</h4>



<p> You might also face a problem seeing what you are cooking. The problem you are experiencing here is that your kitchen lacks task lighting. You might have installed the best ambient lighting, but still find shadows in different areas of your kitchen.</p>



<p> To solve this issue, you should pay attention to functional areas of your kitchen that require task lighting. These areas should have enough light and you ought to install lighting fixtures above them.</p>



<h4> Lighting Fixture is Too Big/Small</h4>



<p> Remodeling your kitchen can make you feel overwhelmed. It could blind you from realizing that you are using either too big or too small lighting fixture for your kitchen. At times, it might not be enough to provide you with the decor you anticipated.</p>



<p> Solve this challenge by choosing the most suitable fixture for your kitchen.<br> Before installing anything, you should think about whether it fits the scale of your kitchen. An experienced designer should help you decide what is best for your kitchen, so don’t forget to consult.</p>



<h4> The Kitchen is Too Bright</h4>



<p> Is your kitchen too bright to the extent that it leaves you with pain in your eyes? Usually, this happens because of the recessed lights you are using. It is quite likely that you used too many to light up the kitchen.</p>



<p> To help you solve this problem, it is vital that you create a lighting plan for your kitchen. Consider your space and decide on the right number of recessed lights that you will require.</p>



<p> A rule of thumb that you should keep in mind is that there are many lighting specialists willing to provide you with expert advice at a fraction of the cost.<br> Consequently, strive to get it right the first time by seeking for assistance before choosing any lighting solution for your kitchen.</p>



<p> Have the design specialist visit your home at a time when the sunlight is facing your kitchen. This will help to determine how much light you need and where to locate it.</p>

However, if you haven’t considered cleaning your fridge, there is a likelihood that you will have expired food stored in this appliance. This happens to many people as they throw fruit and veggies inside the fridge without proper organization. It is vital that you ensure you organize your fridge in a way that you will minimize waste by consuming what went in first.</p>



<p> Picture a scenario when you want to prepare a quick healthy snack on your way to work. What you want is to spend less time looking for ingredients.<br> With the right storage being used in the fridge, you can be sure that the appliance will serve its purpose in the best possible way.</p>



<p> Cleaning the fridge is an activity that shouldn’t be done only once in a year.<br> You should schedule a deep clean at least once every two months. Indeed, there are varying types of refrigerators out there. Regardless, there are various hacks you can utilize to make sure that it is always clean and tidy.</p>



<p> Prior to organizing anything, there are several things that you should consider doing. Of course, you cannot start organizing before cleaning and disinfecting your appliance. The importance of doing this is that it prevents any form of contamination or the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Follow the proceeding steps to deep-clean your fridge before anything else.</p>



<p><strong> Empty the Fridge</strong></p>



<p> You want to clean all the surfaces on your fridge, therefore, the first thing you should do is to empty it. Maybe you have certain foods that you will be concerned about getting spoiled. If this is the case, the best way to clean will be by moving from one section to the other. You could also place perishable food in a cooler as you perform the cleaning.</p>



<p> <strong>Clean all Surfaces</strong></p>



<p> After emptying the fridge, the next thing will be to clean all the surfaces using paper towels or a disinfecting wipe. All the shelves, including the door compartments, should be thoroughly cleaned. As for the drawers, you should remove them from the fridge and allow them to soak for some time before rinsing them.</p>



<p><strong> Reassemble the Fridge</strong></p>



<p> When you are sure that the fridge is completely clean and dry, reassemble everything in place. If you often have an issue with your food causing odors, you should use a deodorizer such as baking soda.</p>



<h3> Developing a Plan</h3>



<p> The process of organizing your fridge begins with a practical plan of how you will do it. It is essential that you use a realistic plan to guide you through the process from one section to the other. The advantage of working with a plan is that you will know where to start and where to end. Moreover, it will help you identify areas you should concentrate on.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Upper Shelf</h3>



<p> Starting with the upper shelves, you should know what to store and how to store them. For instance, the ideal items to store in this section include drinks, deli meats, cheese and food leftovers. Veggies and raw meat should not be stored in this section.</p>



<p> <strong>Proper Labeling</strong></p>



<p> When storing food in the upper shelf, you should also bear in mind that they are perishable. Make sure you label them appropriately. If there are foods that will expire soon, they should be at the front area of the upper shelf. Others that will last longer should be positioned at the back.</p>



<p> <strong>Utilize the Lazy Susan Storage Hack</strong></p>



<p> Regardless of the presence of a wire rack inside your fridge, it doesn’t mean that you cannot organize your fridge using other creative hacks. One of the main challenges you might experience with the wire racks is that it will be difficult to locate certain foods inside your fridge. This happens most often when it is fully packed. You find people remove everything from the fridge so they can access what they need at the back.</p>



<p> Do you know that you can deal with this by utilizing the lazy Susan storage hack. This involves the idea of using a sizable round tray to hold the contents of your fridge. Arranging them in this tray and putting it in the fridge will help you easily access your items. All you will need to do is rotate the tray.<br> There is no need for you to risk spilling condiments while trying to get things at the back of your fridge. Be creative.</p>



<p><strong> Use Hanging Baskets</strong></p>



<p><br> Baskets are handy all around your kitchen, including inside the fridge. There are specially designed baskets that use suction cups to stick to your fridge.<br> These baskets provide a great way of storing small items. These items can easily get lost or they fall from one section to the other. Avoid this by fitting your fridge with these baskets. You might be wondering what you can store in them. Gorguts, cheese roll-ups, waffles or string cheese can be effectively stored in this space.</p>



<p> <strong>Use Wire Shelf Rack</strong></p>



<p> Wire shelf racks can either be used in the lower or upper fridge compartments to create additional space. One section of the rack can hold leftover food and the other section can hold boxed juices. Instead of piling the entire shelf with food containers, you should consider using wire shelf racks. These racks give your fridge a more spacious and beautiful look.</p>



<p> Take note of the fact that the hacks provided in either upper or lower shelves apply to any section inside your fridge. Therefore, you are not limited to using hanging baskets in the upper section only.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Lower Shelf</h3>



<p> After finishing working on the upper shelf, you can proceed to the lower compartment. Since the upper part houses foods that are ready to eat, this area should store raw foods and ingredients. Creative storage ideas that you can incorporate here are as detailed.</p>



<p> <strong>Assemble Like Items Together</strong></p>



<p> Similar items should be grouped together. While doing this, it is essential that you make use of clear baskets. This makes it easy for you to identify what’s inside them. A larger tray can be used to assemble like items together. For instance, different types of veggies can be grouped together in a tray. Don’t forget to first store the veggies independently before bringing them together.<br> This applies to any raw foods that you will want to store here.</p>



<p> <strong>Take Advantage of File Organizers</strong></p>



<p> If you have worked in an office, then you must be aware of what we are talking about. File organizers can be used in the fridge as they create space for storing snacks. Whether you want to store small containers or pouch drinks, these file organizers are handy. To make things more organized, you should consider labeling the sections. Certainly, you should have a clear picture of how this idea will give your fridge a well-structured look.</p>



<p> <strong>Hang Bagged Items</strong></p>



<p> If your fridge has a wire bar, it is highly likely that you might not have used it. These bars can be used to create additional storage space. How? Use curtain rings to hang on these bars. This can then be used to store bagged items in your fridge. Ensure that you use the right hanging clips that will not damage the storage bags.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Crisper Drawer</h3>



<p> The last section of your fridge will be the crisper drawer. We all know those people who store fruits here by just washing and throwing them in. After all, there is nothing that you can do to make the section more organized, right? Well, you&#8217;re wrong.</p>



<p> <strong>Utilize Dividers</strong></p>



<p> Instead of just tossing your fruit and other ingredients in this drawer, you should make use of dividers. These dividers will help you create separate spaces for the varying items you have inside your drawer. For instance, with the help of two or more dividers, oranges, apples and tomatoes can be stored separately.</p>



<p><strong> Use Paper Towels at the Bottom</strong></p>



<p> A huge problem with the bottom drawer is that it is often filled with litter every time we load them with veggies and fruit. Also, the moisture present in the fruit can leave the drawer with a foul smell. To deal with this issue, it is advisable to use a paper towel. Take note of the fact that this should be done prior to loading your drawer. Again, it is imperative that you replace the paper towels at least twice a month. The same can be done each time you feel that the towels need changing. Cleaning the fruit and veggies and drying them thoroughly will aid in odor and spoilage prevention.</p>



<p><strong> Effectively Control the Humidity</strong></p>



<p> We cannot forget that the lower drawer will have humidity controls.<br> However, this will depend on the type of fridge that you own. Modern fridges have these controls to help your veggies and fruits last longer. You have the option of setting the humidity as either low or high.</p>



<p> Before doing this, make sure you understand that setting the humidity dial on high will affect raw foods that can easily rot. Therefore, veggies and fruits should be stored in low humidity. If you have two drawers with different controls, high humidity will suit leafy greens such as herbs, arugula and spinach. The veggies will be fresh for longer due to the high moisture present.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Door</h3>



<p> Compared to other parts of the fridge, this is the warmest area. As such, condiments are best stored in this area. Most people use this area to store milk and eggs. However, you should note that these are perishable items.<br> Hence, they should be stored in the coldest section of the fridge. Items that should be stored here include butter, sauces, and condiments. How do you go about this?</p>



<p> <strong>Store Like Items Together</strong></p>



<p> Any form of organization that goes on in your kitchen should always embrace this principle. When organizing your refrigerator door, you should put like items together. Proper labeling will also be required to make sure you eat foods that are close to expiration. Equally, this labeling also ensures that you keep your fridge neat. It also helps other users in your house to understand where they should store what they just used. Generally, it provides a convenient way of accessing your fridge.</p>



<p> <strong>Egg Carton for Storage</strong></p>



<p> The egg carton that you usually use to hold your eggs can also be used to hold condiments in bottles. Storing them upside-down creates more space in the small door shelves.</p>



<p><strong> Children Drinks go at the Bottom</strong></p>



<p> The last shelf should be designated to hold drinks for your children. For those who don’t have children, the section can be a great place to store snacks. In line with this, you should ensure that you teach your children about where their drinks are located. This will prevent them from looking in other sections as this will only mess things up in the fridge.</p>



<p> <strong>Six-Pack Beer Boxes</strong></p>



<p> The six-pack beer boxes can also be handy for storing things in the fridge door. Smaller condiments can be stored in these boxes. So, you don’t have to throw these boxes if you were looking for a creative way of creating space in your fridge door.</p>



<p> The information detailed in this section provides you with an effective way of ensuring your fridge is organized. At times the process might seem challenging because of the many small things that you have to store in the appliance. However, from what has been discussed, it is the best way of storing your items wisely. What’s more, there is a lot that you stand to benefit, including the fact that you will prevent yourself from wasting food.<br> You cannot ignore the fact that an organized fridge will motivate you to snack on a healthy dish.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Buy the best quality food you can easily afford, it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intuitive-Eating-For-Weight-Loss.jpg" alt="healthy eating" class="wp-image-988"/></figure></div>



<p> I’ve always felt that if food isn’t delicious, it isn’t worth eating. Healthy eating doesn’t mean going on fad diets—or even following a strict diet at all.</p>



<p> It’s about focusing on deliciously satisfying foods that nourish your body and soul—and making them a priority.</p>



<h3> The Golden Principles of Healthy Eating</h3>



<p> So, what is healthy eating? For starters, it means focusing on fresh, whole foods with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables, often referred to as clean eating. It also means choosing unrefined whole grains, such as whole-wheat flour, brown rice, and oats, over more processed options.</p>



<p> When you do venture into those inner aisles for items such as canned beans, packaged chicken stock, or spices, be sure to check the labels. Avoid chemicals and artificial flavors, and monitor for salt and added sugars.</p>



<p> Buy the best quality food you can easily afford—it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers. When it makes sense, look for organic produce and buy meat, dairy, and eggs from sustainable and local sources whose animals are raised humanely and without antibiotics, growth hormones, and other unnecessary restrictions such as being caged.</p>



<h3> The Logistical Challenge</h3>



<p> When you make the commitment to healthier eating habits, you’ll naturally want more control over the quality of the food you eat. That’s difficult when you’re relying on other people to prepare your food, whether it’s in the form of take-out meals or even prepared items from the grocery store. Prepared healthy, clean-eating options can be found, but they tend to be expensive.</p>



<p> The best and most cost-effective way to eat healthy is to make your own meals at home from whole, fresh ingredients. I get how challenging that can seem. We’re all busy; we get home late, and we’re tired. Throw in homework, laundry, after-school or after-work activities and who has the time to cook? Just the idea of cooking can be overwhelming—not to mention that endless pile of dishes that needs to be washed when you’re done.</p>



<p> Even though logistical challenges exist, healthy eating should be a priority. Along with physical activity, it’s crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. When I eat well, I feel better—and I have more energy.</p>



<h3> The One-Pot Solution</h3>



<p> Cooking dinner used to be the last thing I felt like doing after a long day. But once I discovered the beauty of one-pot cooking, my nightly routine was transformed. Now, instead of being tempted by take-out, I know a homemade meal made with nutritious ingredients is just a few minutes away. Plus, as there’s only one pot, cleanup is a breeze!</p>



<p> People have been making one-pot meals on their stovetops and in their ovens for decades, but modern kitchen appliances such as electric pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers make one-pot cooking easier—and healthier—than ever.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Pick a Bad Habit You Want to Change or Choose a Good Habit You Want to Start</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/woman-41891_1280-1.png" alt="Bad habits" class="wp-image-421"/></figure></div>



<h1>Forgive</h1>



<p> Life is a series of moments.<br> Moments make seconds. Seconds make minutes. Minutes make hours. Hours make days. Days make weeks. Weeks make months. Months make years. Years make a lifetime of living.</p>



<p> And in reality, that is how we live – moment to moment.</p>



<p> Every emotion we experience happens in the present. Even if we are giggling about a memory or fretting about the future, we don’t experience either outside of right when we are thinking in the present moment. We are living right now with our feelings – good or bad, happy or sad. And we take them with us from one moment to the next.</p>



<p> But it all starts with the moment we are living right now – this second.</p>



<p> Not convinced? Stop breathing and see if the memory of breathing yesterday comforts you. No one suffocating cares about how they might breathe tomorrow. All they want is to breathe now – at the moment they are experiencing.</p>



<p> Thankfully most of us don’t have to suffocate to get focused on the moment.</p>



<p> The question is, now that you know how important this moment is as a building block of your life, how are you living it? Are you dragging anger and resentment from this one to the next? Are you unwilling to forgive even the simplest slight or harshest transgression at this moment?</p>



<p> Remember moments make seconds that turn quickly into a lifetime of living. Use this moment wisely. Forgive someone. Even if you can only manage to forgive for a second, do it. Keep at it and you will find you have built a lifetime of living in forgiveness. And that’s a good thing.</p>



<h1>Be Hopeful</h1>



<p> Become a prisoner of hope.</p>



<p> Don’t weigh the odds and then make a decision to be optimistic. Don’t try to calculate all the variables. Don’t try to envision every possible outcome.</p>



<p> The universe is too big. The variables are too fluid. There’s no way to wrap the mind around all the possible outcomes in an infinite universe.</p>



<p> Pride comes before the fall. Recognize pride’s arrogance in choosing to be optimistic based on running the numbers. Avoid the fall.</p>



<p> Avoid the fall by not becoming a prisoner of a formula concocted to navigate life. Weighing the odds as a path to optimism fails. Pessimism is always there, lurking in the background. Whatever positive outcome may be yielded from running the numbers draws its inverse as well. Fear stalks success from the shadows of doubt.</p>



<p> Cast aside the shadows. Stand firm in the light inside the cheerful walls of hope. With hope, there are no calculations, no variables to weigh and no negatives to compare.</p>



<p> Hope defies the odds. Faith sees through circumstances. Together, they achieve the impossible and take us where logic will fail us.</p>



<p> Ironically, when we are faced with the darkest times, we often become a prisoner of hope and chain ourselves to faith by default. They are our last resorts when everything else fails us. We surrender and in doing so, achieve what we thought was impossible.</p>



<p> Stop doing the math. Erase the formula. Become a prisoner of hope now, in this moment.</p>



<p> Use this affirmation, “I believe in good. I see the good. I experience good. I know all good is happening for me now.”</p>



<h1> Communicate Effectively</h1>



<p> Have you ever come across a situation where someone is on the losing end just because of his/her lack of effective communication? Well, I have plenty of experiences to elaborate on this phenomenon. Have any of following instances happened with you?</p>



<p> You thought your boss would love your idea, but she did not give it serious consideration because you were not able to make her understand exactly what you meant. You thought your spouse wanted you to praise him/her and indeed you wanted to, but you failed to convey the praise. You did not get a job, although you were the most eligible candidate, because you could not successfully convince the hiring manager to understand your qualifications.</p>



<p> Every once in a while, I used to find myself in one of these types of situations. I then decided to strategize and determine if I could improve my position in these situations by enhancing my communication skills, and trust me, I thank God for that day when He made me move in this direction. We can all continuously improve our communication techniques. Even though you think you are perfect at communicating, you will soon realize that much room for improvement exists once you start working on it. Several rules to the game of communication are key components that you need to keep in mind if you want the receiver of your communications to not just hear you, but listen to you:</p>



<ol><li>The receiver is the king of the game, regardless of who you are and who the receiver is, hopefully the receiver is also a listener, because any kind of communication is effective only if it is two-way i.e., the person with whom you want to communicate is actually listening. So, forget that you are the boss, forget that you are the elder, forget everything and mold yourself to suit the receiver of the communication.</li><li>Do not be too specific or too detailed while communicating (except for SMS, which should be short enough).</li><li>Keep it simple. Do not complicate your language. Complicated language will not do any good except for impressing or tiring the listener and making them think that he/she need not listen as he/she will not understand it anyway. It&#8217;s okay to use jargon sometimes, but do not make it a habit or overuse such terms, at least not in very important communications.</li><li>Clarity of thoughts is an extremely important tool for effective communication as you can only convey something that you understand yourself. Understanding something yourself does not ensure that you will communicate it well, however, so be careful to break it down into manageable nuggets of information.</li><li>Be confident of your position. First, you need to believe something completely, to make others believe it.</li><li>Watch your wording. Sometimes, you may tend to use words that you do not really want to use, and in fact you do not even know how they will impact the listener. Be careful and keep watch over your own vocabulary, and avoid talking without thinking at all. Use a filter before speaking. Some filters may be: Is this true? Is this relevant? Is this hurtful? Is this biased? Do I want someone to repeat this and quote me? Try to be politically correct at least in public places, if not with family.</li></ol>



<p> I hope you seriously consider adopting these techniques. Enjoy your day. </p>



<h1>Calm Your Mind</h1>



<p> Calm your mind at this moment. It’s really not that big of a challenge.<br> Nothing is that challenging because nothing is permanent. Nothing lasts forever. Not one physical item. Your car, house, the street on which you live, and the city in which you live can fall away without a moment’s notice.<br> Nothing is permanent. Every tree, every bird, every rock, every drop of water evaporates into the nothingness from whence it came. Even your body will return to its origins and break down into the very molecules and atoms that make the universe.</p>



<p> Ashes to ashes and dust to dust are not an end, but another step on a journey everything and everyone will take.<br> That’s the challenge. We temporarily mitigate the challenge by preserving museum artifacts and by keeping bodies functioning longer with medical advances. We write our thoughts on paper, in books, on computer chips, and in the vast cloud of technology. Eventually, they will all go the way of dust.</p>



<p> The only big challenge about anything is the importance we give it in our own minds. The universe doesn’t care. Even stars eventually grow cold and wink out of existence. What chance does your favorite chair have against that? No chance at all.</p>



<p> This is not to say we shouldn’t try. We should try because life is worth living.<br> It’s just that when we can accept the impermanence of everything in the universe, we gain perspective.<br> Perspective saves us from the disaster of thinking and acting as if what we’re doing, or wanting or holding onto are the most important things in the universe. Stars eventually grow cold and wink out of existence. What chance does your coveted item, your brilliant scheme, your careful planning have against that? No chance at all.</p>



<p> Keep everything in perspective. Mt. Everest is but a speck from space. A diamond is still a rock. One man’s treasure is another man’s trash. There’s always a bigger fish to catch.<br> Calm your mind at this moment. It’s not that big of a challenge.<br> Free yourself from fear with perspective. Appreciate and give thanks for the people and things you have now – today.<br> Take deep, relaxing breaths with this affirmation, “I live in the moment with everything and everyone. I accept all my good and give thanks for what is now.”</p>



<h1>Reduce Sugar Intake</h1>



<p> You are getting so close; congratulations! Take a moment and celebrate your success today! You have come extremely far and are right on the cusp of completing this program and jump-starting your new and improved life. Let’s finish strong!</p>



<p> Today, we are going to replace one sugary drink with a tall, cool glass of water. Our bodies are made up primarily of water and we need to continuously pump more and more in to replace what we lose in sweat. Your body needs optimal amounts of water to function at max capacity and keep you running strong and smooth all day long. Try and find an area where you can make this essential swap that will offer multiple benefits to your health and to your life.</p>



<p> Do you drink sugary sodas, flavored coffees, iced mochas, even diet sodas loaded with artificial sugars? If so, these are what we are looking to replace.<br> Don’t worry, I am not asking you to go cold turkey and give them up all together. Start by replacing just one and work your way up from there.</p>



<p> By making the switch to water you will feel full, causing you to eat less. You will feel more hydrated which has benefits for your mental alertness and skin tone. You will be sheltered from the typical crash that comes along with a burst of sugar, helping you to be more productive throughout the day. Plus, you will save the calories, helping you to lose weight and look and feel better. Now, who doesn’t want that?</p>



<h1>Relax and Let Good Things Happen</h1>



<p> Be encouraged. There are seven billion people in the world. All of them are moving through life just like you. They stumble. They fall. They get up and keep moving.</p>



<p> They move through the bad and get to the good. They move through the good and get to the bad. Then they move through the worst, and eventually get to the good stuff again.<br> And so it goes, on and on…<br> Like mice constantly searching for cheese, people live life running back and forth between good and bad, ultimately hunting for something better. They are anxious and fearful even in good times because the next bad thing is right around the corner. When the bad times come they are anxious and fearful because, well…things are bad. How else are you supposed to feel?</p>



<p> Good to bad, bad to good, good to bad, bad to good, and back again. The whole thing is crazily exhausting. Honestly running back and forth between the two extremes should drive a person insane – because it is crazy to run in circles all the time.</p>



<p> That’s the world – crazy. And the world expects you to be crazy right along with it. Stop running around like a crazy person!<br> Be encouraged. Good things are happening. Relax and let them happen to you. Notice the good in you and your life. Even when things seem bad, even when things are legitimately bad, good is still there – right where you are at the moment.</p>



<p> Pay attention to the good. Give thanks for the good. If all you have is one slice of bread, eat it with a grateful heart. If you have two slices of bread with your favorite meat, lettuce and tomatoes, but no mayo, eat the sandwich and be grateful. You don’t have to starve to learn how to take what you have and be grateful because it beats being hungry.</p>



<p> This is not a lesson about settling for less. Far from it, this is a lesson about getting more. Recognize what is truly good by being grateful for what sustains you and keeps you alive. The rest is extra stuff that’s nice to have, but won’t kill you if you don’t. Rise above crazy and know goodness.<br> Congratulations on all of your progress throughout this journey and I hope you continue moving forward in a positive direction. See you tomorrow for the final day of our 21-day challenge.</p>



<h1> Review Your Previous Habits and Set New Goals</h1>



<p> Give yourself a massive pat on the back for making it through this 21 Day exercise! All of these changes were small in nature, but I am hoping that you truly saw massive gains in your life. And, I hope it does not stop here. I hope you continue to put into practice the techniques we went through together to ensure exponential growth in your personal and professional lives. On our final day together, I want you to review and work on new goals.</p>



<p> Do you remember those goals you wrote out in Chapter 1 on the very first day of reading this book? I want you to dig those out and re-read them now.<br> Really spend some time walking through them and thinking about them.<br> Now, spend a few minutes answering the following questions about those goals:</p>



<p> Did you achieve any of the goals you set on day 1?<br> Were there any goals that you did not achieve, but you came really close to achieving?<br> How have your goals changed since you started this book?<br> ❖ Are your goals more singular, more focused or broader?<br> ❖ Have your priorities and goals shifted in any way?<br> ❖ Did some goals seem daunting in the beginning, but now seem too easy?</p>



<p> After this review, I am sure some of you have already started working on new goals; or, at least making adjustments to your existing goals. Get creative with them, and have a little fun letting your imagination wander. </p>



<p><strong>Best of luck and keep driving forward!</strong></p>

<h2>1) Create a Budget that will Work for You</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1.jpg" alt="wallet" class="wp-image-853" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> This is where so many people become confused and give up when they are trying to live on less, but it does not have to be difficult. You need to learn how to create a realistic budget and how to stick to it.</p>



<p> Budgets are easy, but sometimes when you have more going out than what is coming in, stress follows. For now, don’t worry about balancing your budget, just worry about all of your main bills and your income.</p>



<p> Start by adding up all of the money you have coming into your home. If you have money coming in that is not guaranteed, such as child support, do not count this as your income. Only count what you know you will get no matter what. This is the amount on which you are going to base all of your spendings. The money that is not guaranteed can be considered a bonus, and we will discuss it later.</p>



<p> Next, add up all of the essential bills you have to pay. This means your electric, your phone, your internet, your cable, house payment and so forth.<br> Do not count discretionary items, such as going out to eat, purchasing clothing and entertainment. Only list the living expenses that you have to pay.</p>



<p> Grab a notebook and use it specifically for budgeting your money. At the top of the page, you are going to write your income. Then create a column of bills and debts you need to pay such as house payment and electricity. Next to the bills, write down the amount that is paid. For bills such as your electricity, use an average payment. For example, my electric is higher in the winter but very low in the summer, by using an average I am able to leave some money in the bank in the summer to use for electric in the winter. (Tip: Many utility companies allow you to pay the average monthly.)</p>



<p> Add up the total of all of your bills and see how it compares to the amount of money you have coming in. If you don’t have enough money coming in to cover what is going out, you will have to make some changes.</p>



<p> Finally, at the bottom of the page, you need to list additional items for which you typically need money, such as birthdays, school supplies, or clothing.<br> These are items that may not come up every month but still need to be periodically covered.</p>



<p> Once you have this completed, you are ready to start looking at what can be cut from your budget so that you are able to live on less. But what are the benefits of being able to live on less? (Maybe the cable is not as important as you thought, especially if you are constantly stressing over not having enough money every month.)</p>



<p> I once saw a Facebook post that said, “We spend our entire life focusing on earning a living so that we can have a happy life, then we find out that we are so busy earning a living that we have no life to enjoy.” Learning to live on less will ensure that you have time to actually enjoy life and not waste it working all the time.</p>



<h2>2) Take a Walk</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1.jpg" alt="walking" class="wp-image-854" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Many health experts recommend at least 10,000 steps per day for a healthy lifestyle. I’m here to tell you that unless you are a server at a busy restaurant or a professional runner, getting 10,000 steps per day is HARD. I struggle to get them in on a daily basis, but when I do, I notice a difference in how I feel and in my energy levels. For me, walking has so many benefits that improve not only my physical health, but also my mental health.</p>



<p> First and foremost, walking gets the blood flowing. Taking a walk is exercise and it is essential for good cardiovascular health. Walking gives me a few minutes to escape and let my mind wander to things of interest to me and not just work or what my family should have for dinner that night. Sometimes, I just walk to clear my head, and getting moving allows me the opportunity to step away from it all, even if for only 15 minutes. In addition, I recommend trying to take your walk outside, if at all possible to breathe in the fresh air and soak up some vitamin D.</p>



<p> I know some of you are thinking that you would love to take walks, but you just don’t have the time. Maybe you have meetings and conference calls all day and just don’t have an extra 15-20 minutes to step away. Trust me I have days like these as well. In this situation, I like to schedule it so that I can take at least one of my calls on the move. I put on my earbuds with the built-in microphone and listen or talk while I walk. I’ve actually found that some of my best calls have come while I’m out on a walk, as exercise and physical activity have been proven to improve brain function. So, if you don’t take a walk for yourself, take it for your company; they’ll be glad you did. Get out there and get to stepping!</p>



<h2>3) Organize Your house</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg" alt="house cleaning" class="wp-image-855" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Hang a corkboard in your mudroom or foyer to help keep you organized as you dash out of the house. The board is perfect for those shopping lists, prescriptions, or reminder notes that you seem always to be forgetting. Give it some extra functionality by screwing a magnetic knife holder to the frame of your cork board. Use it to hold keys (not good for car keys with built-in chips), scissors, a screwdriver, and even a small flashlight.</p>



<p> Hang a large tote bag in a common area and use it to collect clothing and other items destined for donation.</p>



<p> Buy some clear plastic business card sheets to organize all those cards lying about. These sheets are also handy for organizing sewing kits, embroidery thread or even coupons. The larger divider sheets are perfect for storing recipes.</p>



<p> Between cell phones, MP3 players, PDA&#8217;s, you name it, we have more devices charging than we have counter space. Organize your electronic chargers in one box with a hole in the bottom to insert a power bar cord.<br> Attach the power bar to the bottom of the box and plug in all your electronic toys. Keep the lid open when in use to prevent heat build up.</p>



<p> Clothespins aren&#8217;t just for hanging wet clothes. They make great closet organizers for hats, mitts and scarves. Glue the pins to the inside of closet doors and keep your mitts organized in the cold weather. Use the same idea in an office cupboard to hang memos, cards, photos or small calendars.</p>



<p> Use pretty glass knobs or other coordinating hardware to hang towels over the sink in the laundry room.</p>



<p> Sometimes candles will sit in a drawer for an entire year without being used, and they may easily be broken during that time. Next time you empty a roll of paper towels, use your empty cardboard roll to store candles, labeling each tube with the color and size of the candle.</p>



<p> The next time you have to go poking around a dark place like your crawl space or fuse box, have a flashlight ready to go. If your flashlight is metal, simply attach a small magnet to the outside of the fuse box, or glue a strip of Velcro for plastic versions. Do not forget to put batteries in the flashlight.</p>



<p> If you purchase large bags of dog food, simply empty into a small garbage pail for easy storage. Close the lid tightly and the food will stay fresh for weeks.</p>



<p> Organize the cupboard under the sink by hanging small items like scrubbers, rubber gloves and dust rags on clothespins or hooks found to the door’s inside.</p>



<p> These are just some ideas, but the idea is to look around, embrace the clutter you see and do something about it!</p>



<h2>4) Pause and Give Thanks</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1.jpg" alt="thankful" class="wp-image-856" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Texts, emails and social media got us running. Bills, work and hustling for money got us running. Five minutes into the day and we are humming.<br> Life is a whirlwind moving along at the speed of light.<br> We got dreams. We got plans. We’re building a better life.<br> That’s good but we don’t live in dreams. We can’t experience the joy of life in plans. We can’t build a better life without appreciating the life we’re living now.<br> Pause for a moment and take a look at your surroundings. Stay at the moment.<br> Look at life.<br> Look for the good. Look for what’s going right. See the blessings. Take it all in and give thanks.</p>



<p> Yes, things may not be as excellent as you would like. Give thanks for the good you see. Yes, many things may not be going exactly as you would like.<br> Give thanks for what is turning in your favor. And yes, it’s hard to bless the mess you may be experiencing. Do it anyway.</p>



<p> Reclaim your power. Show the world that society cannot bind you, technology cannot grind you, and fear cannot find you. Be the boss of you. Step out of the world. Step into faith.<br> Focus your heart and mind on good and declare for yourself that everything – everything – is all right. Nothing has power over you.</p>



<p> Free yourself now, at this moment with this affirmation, “Everything is all right with me and my world. Only good happens to me. Everything is all right with me and my world. Only good happens to me. Everything is all right with me and my world.</p>



<h2>5) Ask for Help</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1.jpg" alt="ask for help" class="wp-image-857" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> If you are anything like me, then you have a problem admitting that you can’t do it all. I really struggle with not having the answers or not being able to handle everything in my life, on my own. I’m the one who helps others, not the other way around. Well, I’m here to tell you two things:</p>



<ol><li>No one can do everything on their own and no one is an expert in all things.</li><li>It’s ok to seek help, guidance or advice from someone who is better than you at a task or an area of life.</li></ol>



<p>Take an opportunity today to think of an area where you are not as strong as you would like to be. This could be any skill, including time management, money management, sales, writing, spreadsheets or something simple like doing a cart wheel. Find someone who is successful in an area where you could stand to improve and find out what they did to achieve this level of success. Tell them what you admire about them and seek their guidance. You would be surprised how many folks are willing to share their knowledge, especially when you stroke their ego a little.</p>



<p> If I could leave you with one key piece of advice from today’s lesson it could be summed up in two words. Be vulnerable. It’s ok to put yourself out there and admit you have weaknesses; because we all do. Weaknesses do not make you weak, but not admitting them will. Putting yourself out there and being vulnerable can be a key driver to success. It makes us uncomfortable, and stretches our boundaries, and ultimately teaches us something new.<br> Having trouble getting the conversation started? Try these icebreakers…<br> • “Would you mind helping me with…?”<br> • “I’ve noticed you are amazing at . Do you have 30 minutes to show me a few tricks?” </p>



<p> These are easy, to the point and difficult to say “no” to. Try it; the results will be phenomenal!</p>



<h2>6) Fill Your Heart with Love and Conquer Fear</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1.jpg" alt="heart love" class="wp-image-858" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Fear is the root of all anger, discord and conflict. Trace any negative action to its source and you will find fear.</p>



<p> Fear turns discussions into arguments, dislike into hatred and anger into murder. It can poison relationships and sabotage success. Unchecked fear will kill everything it touches – even you.</p>



<p> The first lesson a person learns when swimming is not to be afraid of the water. Fear causes panic. People who panic drown. The way to stop panicking and drowning is to calm down and float. The same is true when facing life’s challenges.</p>



<p> When the arguing starts and you get a tightening in your belly, ask yourself what is it that we are talking about that makes me so afraid that now I am getting angry?</p>



<p> When the insult causes you to flinch and the anger swells, stop and reflect on the source. When the little pebble of dislike drops, before you say, “I don’t like so-and-so,” trace the reason to the root and you will find fear. You will also find fear at the root of a scary decision. Fear leads you to jump to conclusions and embrace bad decisions based on a boogey man shouting “what-ifs” at you.</p>



<p> Remember, fear causes panic. People who panic drown. Don’t drown in the situation. Calm down and float. Shift your attention to love.</p>



<p> You may not feel the love in the heat of the moment. But if you are thinking love, you are not thinking about smacking someone upside their head. Even if all you can manage is to spell the word “L-O-V-E” in your mind, your brain is too busy to try to come up with the clever retort or insult in response. You are thinking love. You are calming down and floating.</p>



<p> You may not think love is the solution to a serious problem you are trying to solve or dilemma you are trying to unravel. Love will stop you from drowning in a pool of doubt as you flail about looking for an answer. Even if all you can manage at first is spelling the word love in your mind when you think of the challenge, this simple act will allow you to calm down and float.</p>



<p> Eventually, you will make a better decision because you will be acting out of love instead of acting out of fear. Love conquers fear. Put love in your heart now. When you draw on this love in a moment of battling fear, draw upon it as your armor against fear; the love you put there now will still be there, use it.</p>



<p> Here’s a love centering affirmation, “This situation has no power over me. I am love. Love is me. I find the right and perfect solution in the right and perfect way to every challenge.”</p>



<h2>7) Replace One Unhealthy Snack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1.jpg" alt="Unhealthy Snack" class="wp-image-859" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> For today’s task, I want you to take one unhealthy snack and replace it with something nutritious. Perhaps, instead of potato chips, you make the move to carrots and hummus. Or, instead of a candy bar, you reach for an apple. You will be surprised how filling an apple can be. Not to mention, it is full of nutrients and is surprisingly sweet.</p>



<p> Trust me, I have been there. It is incredibly convenient AND delicious to grab that unhealthy snack and bypass the stuff that actually has nutritional value. But, if you can make that switch, you will end up taking in fewer calories while adding additional nutrients. These small but significantly better choices will lead to a healthier lifestyle, a better fitting wardrobe, and a better looking, more productive you. Go out there and eat well and look and feel great! Remember, one good choice leads to another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class="has-text-color has-large-font-size has-very-dark-gray-color"><strong>The Seven Days Phase</strong></p>



<h3>Day 1: Note Down Your Goals</h3>



<p> I cannot stress enough how important it is to not only have goals, but to write them down. To me, if it is not written down it is merely a wish or a dream. A written goal has legitimacy and a purpose that dreams just do not. Writing down your goals will help you to remember them in vivid detail, especially when the road gets tougher. Remember, a goal recognizes you are not currently where you want to be, but provides recognition that you do have the desire and the ability to find a path to get there.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goals-review-1.jpg" alt="goals planner" class="wp-image-843" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goals-review-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goals-review-1-300x213.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Take 5 minutes or 60 minutes, whatever it takes, and write down 3-5 goals that you hope to accomplish in this process. Write down 3-5 goals that you want to achieve in the next 21 days, two months or one year to come. Finally, write out 3-5 crazy, out-of-this-world goals that you’re almost too embarrassed to admit. I’ll share with you one of mine. I am not in the entertainment business. I am not an actor, I am not a director, nor do I have a talent for either of these things. However, I have a goal to win an Oscar and stand on that stage by the time I’m 45 years old. I know it’s crazy, but it’s on my list…see, it’s not so hard. The important thing is to HAVE goals, no matter how “out there” they are. If you do not have a clear view of where you are going, how are you ever going to get there?</p>



<p> If you’re still having trouble coming up with your goals, then try answering these questions:</p>



<ol><li> What vacation would I love to take with my family? </li><li> How much money do I want to make? </li></ol>



<p> If the above questions don’t get you where you feel like you need to be, it’s ok to start a little broader. </p>



<p> Now that your goals have been articulated AND written down, spend the day thinking about them. Make sure they are important to you and on the path towards where you ultimately want to go. From personal experience, achieving a goal that has little to no true meaning to you will be extremely<br> difficult.</p>



<p> Have an awesome day and let’s meet up again tomorrow after you have let your goals percolate a bit!</p>



<h3>Day 2: Determine a Reason to be Optimistic Today</h3>



<p> First, always be optimistic: You might have observed some people in your life who never consider taking a positive approach to their lives, rather they keep obsessing about past regrets. They always focus on the negative prior incidents, rather than the positive experiences they have encountered. So, they need to shift to an optimistic approach to life that can help them understand how to stay happy throughout their life.</p>



<p> Pause and ponder about this for a moment. We are always searching for evidence to confirm the worst. I won’t get that job because I am too old or too young. I will never win because I never win anything. I can’t afford a new car, new dress or a new coat. So we don’t get the job, win the contest or buy that new thing. We don’t even try. If you don’t enter a contest, you certainly cannot win it.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/be-optimistic-message-1.jpg" alt="be optimistic" class="wp-image-847" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/be-optimistic-message-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/be-optimistic-message-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/be-optimistic-message-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/be-optimistic-message-1-65x65.jpg 65w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> We don’t try because we already know the reason why something won’t work for us, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. What would happen if we looked for a reason why something positive will happen instead? Our attitude about trying would change for the better. That’s the first thing that will happen – we start off with a positive attitude and march forward.</p>



<p> Take this moment to imagine one reason why you will accomplish the goal you want to succeed at today. If you can find two, make a mental note of two. When you find three reasons why something will work for you instead of fail, you are well on your way.</p>



<p> Now look for the evidence you are right to believe you will accomplish this goal. Be open to little things such as encouraging words from people, a chance meeting or an unexpected stroke of luck. Give thanks for each piece of evidence and accept it with a grateful heart.</p>



<p> Here’s a powerful way to reinforce your desire to succeed at anything today. Say out loud, “I am optimistic. I know good things are happening for me.<br> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”</p>



<p> Repeat it throughout the day – especially if you find nagging doubt about something you want to do. Say it. Think it. Be it. Find a reason to be optimistic. Remember, there is always a reason, so dig as deep as necessary in order to surface it.</p>



<h3> Day 3: Make or Organize Your Bed</h3>



<p> Before you leave the house this morning, make your bed. I know it seems like a small and trivial task, but I have a feeling it will work wonders for you. It is a task that only requires a few minutes of your time but can help jumpstart your day in ways you have probably never dreamed imaginable. Key benefits include:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bed-1.jpg" alt="bed" class="wp-image-845" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bed-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bed-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Starting your day with productivity<br>Starting out with something productive will help you maintain that mindset as you face more difficult challenges throughout your day.</li><li> Starting your day with something active<br>Get up, get moving and get the blood flowing to activate the awesomeness coming your way today.</li><li> Starting your day by checking something off your list<br>Completing a task can set off a chain reaction of activities designed at<br>completing more tasks. Start with something small and work your way up to something HUGE!</li><li> Starting your day with a WIN</li></ul>



<p> It is always a positive when you start out your day with a goal and then you achieve it; no matter how small that goal may be.</p>



<p> In addition to the many benefits making your bed has on the start of your day, it can be beneficial to the end of your day as well. A made bed is considerably more appealing to crawl into after you’ve just crushed your day. And, with any luck, the appealing bed you so diligently made earlier this morning will produce a better night’s rest to help you move even closer to your goals tomorrow.</p>



<p> Already make your bed every day? Spend time reflecting on how it is a positive in your life that is helping you achieve your goals. I’d be willing to bet, you’ve never thought about this daily routine as something that will drive you closer to your dream life. Want extra credit? Write yourself a positive note and leave it on your pillow as a gift to yourself for the end of the day.</p>



<h3> Day 4: Be Grateful for Everything</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/alone-beautiful-woman-body-of-water-2423533-1.jpg" alt="Meditation" class="wp-image-363"/></figure></div>



<p> We often think of happiness as causing us to spontaneously jump up and down for joy, laugh hysterically or smile until our cheeks burst.</p>



<p> Of course, those are all outward signs of happiness.</p>



<p> But you don’t always have to make a spectacle of yourself to be happy.</p>



<p> Sometimes you can just be still and content, enjoying the feeling that everything is all right.</p>



<p> Remember being a kid and laying on the grass just gazing at the sky? At that moment, everything was all right in the world. But you didn’t care at that moment in time, just laying there gazing at the sky. To you, everything was all right. And so that’s how you let everything be in that singular, magical moment.</p>



<p> That’s being grateful. That’s happiness too.</p>



<p> How wonderful life is when we can be grateful for nothing at all. Little kids have this ability down pat.</p>



<p> You were a little kid once. You shook off the worries of the day and just gazed at the sky. Now the ups and downs of the years have taken their toll. It’s not so easy anymore.<br> Or is it?<br> That little sky gazing kid is still you. Now is a good time to let your inner kid out again and be grateful for seemingly nothing at all.</p>



<p> Take a few minutes to remember a sky gazing moment. Maybe you were mesmerized by the ocean. Maybe you lost yourself in a blade of grass. Maybe you were caught in the magic of falling snow.</p>



<p> Search your heart and find that memory. Bring it forward and feel it all over again. Then go outside. Lose yourself in the sky, the moon, the stars, the rain, or whatever catches your fancy.</p>



<p> Be still and just let everything be right with the world again.<br> Try this affirmation, “I am young in spirit and free. I see the good in life and good comes to me. I am blessed with a wonderful, warm home. I am blessed with [insert two of your most readily apparent positive aspects of your life].”</p>



<h3> Day 5: Mark Your Nutrition</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/weight-loss-Treat-Days.jpg" alt="weight loss Treat Days" class="wp-image-966"/></figure></div>



<p> Today’s activity involves writing down everything that goes into your body. I would like for you to keep a food journal that tracks your food and beverage intake for an entire day. The idea here is to not beat yourself up for the food choices that you’re making, but to have an inventory of what you are consuming. Knowledge is power, especially with your food.</p>



<p> We all know that your body needs fuel, but we also know that it needs the right type. We are operating high-performance machines! You probably wouldn’t put the lowest grade of gas into a Lamborghini, would you? Why do the same to your body? You also wouldn’t keep pumping after the tank is full, right? So, no need to keep eating once your body tells you it’s had enough.</p>



<p> I feel that most of us (myself definitely included) do not realize how much we are eating in a given day or how often. Snacking, when not controlled, can be a dangerous increase in calories. In addition to how often we are eating, most of us struggle with portion control. The hope is that by keeping a log of food and beverage intake then we can make better choices going forward leading to improved health, energy and stamina.</p>



<p> If you need help tracking, it can be as simple as a piece of paper or as extensive as a notebook purchased strictly for this exercise. Another great option would be an app. Numerous free apps are available that help you track your food and beverage intake and can make it very simple and convenient for you. The idea here is to make it as simple as possible so that you are able to stick with it.</p>



<p> Oh, and one last thing, DO NOT READ YOUR JOURNAL. We will work on the results tomorrow, but for tonight, only write and track; do not read.</p>



<h3> Day 6: Smile Before Leaving the House</h3>



<p> We put on shirts, skirts or pants, and shoes. We pick our colors in all kinds of hues. We dress to express and impress.</p>



<p> We wear boots to protect against the snow. We wear coats to protect against the rain. We wear hats to protect against the sun.</p>



<p> We slip on sunglasses and sandals. We carry purses and bags. We grab laptops, cell phones and keys.</p>



<p> We arm ourselves with all the tools we need to face the day. Except we forget the one fashion accessory we really need – a smile.</p>



<p> Smiles can open closed minds and melt warm hearts. They can turn a ‘no’ into a ‘yes’ in the blink of an eye. In fact, a smile can catch an eye in a blink.<br> The right smile is disarming and charming. It is a shield against the ills of the world. Backed up with love, a smile can help you conquer the world.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/optimistic-women-1.jpg" alt="optimistic women" class="wp-image-844" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/optimistic-women-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/optimistic-women-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> It’s your secret weapon. Hone it to perfection.<br> Stand in the mirror and smile. Smile at yourself. Smile with love on your heart. Smile until you feel it and know it to be you.</p>



<p> Then go face the world.<br> You’ll get all its treasure and enjoy it with pleasure.<br> Your smile is your greatest asset. Never leave home without it.<br> Here’s a smile boosting affirmation, “My smile is love and love is my smile. I am beautiful.”</p>



<h3> Day 7: Wake Up 20 Minutes Earlier</h3>



<p> Today’s task will take place at the end of the day. I know to most of us, sleep is a precious resource of which we never have enough. Health experts recommend 6-8 hours per night and that can really be a struggle for many of us with jobs, kids and chores around the house. With that said, having an extra 20 minutes in the morning can help knock out some of those dreaded chores, or at the very least, help to prevent you from rushing around in the morning trying to get out the door. This rush will inevitably kick off your day with a stress-filled anxiety attack. Starting your day in this manner can have halo effects on everything else you do that day and can prevent you from living your best life to the fullest potential.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wakeup-1.jpg" alt="wakeup" class="wp-image-846" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wakeup-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wakeup-1-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> I am not saying that setting your alarm 20 minutes earlier will not be a challenge; especially at first. This is one piece that will take some getting used to, but I promise, you will adapt and you will thank me later. I think you will find that it will take less time than you think to get your body acclimated and ready to roll on 20 minutes less sleep. If you’re still struggling after a few days, there is always the option of going to bed 20 minutes earlier, which may happen naturally if you have less chores in the evening and are more relaxed.</p>



<p> Now that you have your alarm set 20 minutes earlier, the hard part starts. You actually have to WAKE UP AND GET OUT OF BED when the alarm goes off. You may need to try tricks like placing your alarm clock far away from the bed, so you have to actually get up to go and switch it off. REMOVE THE SNOOZE. I promise, you’ll love it (although maybe not at first).</p>



<p> For me, getting up earlier has had many life-changing benefits. First, I’ve found that I really enjoy the quietness of my house. There is something very soothing about a dark and quiet house while I have my coffee. Also, it gives me time to do something that maybe I’ve been putting off. Sometimes, when I’m feeling really ambitious, I’ll put on a YouTube video of a beginner’s 20- minute yoga routine. I’ve discovered that it really gets my blood pumping while helping me calm down and relax all at the same time. Finally, as mentioned above, I feel less rushed when I get up a few minutes earlier, which sets the tone for a peaceful, positive and productive day.</p>



<p> So, go for it! Set that alarm! Get up early! And, start your day WINNING! I cannot wait to talk to you tomorrow.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Dining Out</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1.jpg" alt="dining-out" class="wp-image-678" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> When we want to get together with someone, what do we usually say? How about lunch? Let’s get together for dinner? Face it, a lot of socializing takes place over a meal. How do you deal with that when you’re on a diet? For myself, I dealt with it much the same way as everything else—head on.<br> One of the things I did when I was dieting was to make sure that I ate breakfast—in fact, many mornings I would have a rather large breakfast. Many evenings I was able to eat a light dinner, by reminding myself that I would be having a large, satisfying breakfast in the morning. Consequently, a get together with friends for a big breakfast on the weekends worked out very well for me.<br> If I was meeting someone in the evening, it required discipline. It wasn’t impossible, because I had taken ownership of my goal. I would usually have a large salad and drinks. I didn’t really limit myself when it came to drinks. For the most part, I only drank when I went out and usually two or three. Today, I probably drink more because I’ll have a drink at home too. Just because my diet and exercise are a lifestyle doesn’t mean I deny myself anything. In fact, I feel that because I don’t deny myself what I want, I’m able to maintain my diet and exercise lifestyle.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> Rituals</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Sharing food is a custom that we have in our society, in and around social interactions. The food is not the main thing, the people you are with is really what matters. You can meet someone for lunch and have lousy food, yet still have a good time because of the social interaction over the meal. The reverse is also true. You can have great food and a lousy time. The food itself is really not that important when it comes to socializing.<br> I have a story about a social gathering that illustrates some of our feelings around food. Many years ago, when I was very fat, I was at a dinner party of about a dozen people. The food was very good and everyone was enjoying the event. The food was placed on serving plates on a large table that we all sat around. One of the particularly tasty dishes went very fast, except for one piece, the last piece. I was looking at the last piece and I really wanted it. However, there was a part of me that just couldn’t take it and it appeared that no one else was able to take it either. I happened to be sitting across from a psychologist, so I thought I would ask him why it is that most people won’t take the last piece. He told me something very interesting. He said that when people are in a group, they are self-conscious of appearing greedy. Most people feel that if they take the last piece of something, they will look greedy. When he said that, I promptly took the last piece and enjoyed it very much. What I found interesting is that it’s not a matter of actually being greedy—it’s a matter of appearing greedy. It seems clear to me that we are very concerned with how we appear in social situations, and there are a whole lot of unspoken rules that we follow, whether they make sense or not. Perhaps at one time they did make sense, but, at this point, they are just rituals that we go through because we feel this is how we will be accepted by the group.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> What’s the most important thing about socializing with others? It’s the socializing itself, not the food you eat while socializing. Why is it, then, that food enters into the situation so frequently? Have you ever played poker? When you play poker, obviously the most important thing is the card game itself. However, if you only pay attention to the cards, you will probably lose. The cards are important, but cards do not play the game, people play the game. If you don’t pay attention to the people, you’ll miss half the game. No matter how good some of the players are, they can only play the cards they are dealt. How they play the cards they’re dealt is what separates the winners from the losers. It’s not just a matter of bluffing when you have a lousy hand, although that’s certainly part of it. It’s also knowing when it’s not worth it, and it’s time to fold, so that you are still able to play the next hand. If you’re playing poker, and are not paying attention to these things in your opponents and yourself, then you are at a disadvantage. It’s not always easy to spot what your opponents are thinking or doing in the middle of a game. Something every good player looks for in their opponents are tells. Tells are subconscious cues that your opponents give off, like tapping their foot when they’re bluffing. Tells are usually not that obvious.<br> In fact, they almost never are. Sometimes you may not even realize that you are picking up on them, but you will still react to them. That’s where poker and socializing with food overlap.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>The Food Pusher</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Only the odd time does food become an issue when socializing, but only with a particular type of person and I think we’ve all met that person. They are what I call the food pusher. Your parents are not going to change unless they want to change. Since they are, by their nature, older than you are, don’t hold your breath.<br> The food pushers are the people who will not take no for an answer and they come in two general varieties, overtly aggressive and passive aggressive.<br> The overtly aggressive food pusher is the person who keeps dumping food on your plate that you did not ask for, and may not even like. Then, in a loud booming voice they say, “Eat!!!” The overtly aggressive food pusher actually means well and is usually trying to be hospitable. They are usually people who only know how to communicate using the language of aggression. Because of the way that they communicate, these people have to be dealt with in a firm manner.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Treating</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Getting back to run-of-the-mill socializing—socializing over a meal should not be an issue if you have taken ownership of your weight. You may not have control over every craving that you have, or all the whacked out food pushers out there. However, there’s nothing that says you can’t indulge in a little treating as opposed to cheating. The idea is that you are allowing yourself an indulgence, as opposed to giving in to a craving or someone dumping food on your plate.<br> There is a big difference. As the owner of your weight, you have control, even when you decide to go off your diet as a treat or celebration. There’s nothing to feel guilty about, even if your indulgence results in the gain of a pound or two.<br> First of all, you’ll be weighing yourself regularly so you will be aware of the situation long before it snowballs into a larger problem. Secondly, you will have the tools to address the situation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Enjoy Your Food With Others/Avoid Binging On Your Own</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> I have always loved food and I still do. However, for the most part, I did the majority of my serious eating on my own. In other words, I didn’t pig out in front of other people in a social situation. In fact, I compensated to the point that I would usually eat much less than normal in social situations. It’s okay to enjoy your food in social situations.<br> If you’re like me, the only person holding you back from enjoying your food is yourself. <br> It has to do with your attitude towards food—food is something we all need, so the idea of not eating is simply not realistic. Okay, we’ve established that you have to eat. You need energy to sustain your body.<br> That’s the need aspect of food. However, when we talk about loving food and enjoying food in a social situation, we’re talking about the want aspect of food.<br> When someone is starving to death, chocolate cheesecake is not really what they need. Chocolate cheesecake usually falls into the want column, but not always. In certain situations, it can be a need. However, that is very unusual.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Balance</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cake-1571747_1280-1.jpg" alt="Cake" class="wp-image-359"/></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> You shouldn’t deny yourself an opportunity to participate in something any more than you should deny your desire for good food. Many times, the hardest thing is the anticipation. For myself, I noticed that my fears were always worst before an event, when I was by myself. I found people very accepting and, in some cases, quite encouraging. We tend to get worked up over something not very serious and make it seem much worse than it is.<br> What I’ve found is that many people are more concerned with the drama in their own lives to consider the drama we’ve worked up in our own minds. This shows us that too much subjective thinking will give us a distorted view of the way things really are. By the same token, too much objective thinking is not the way to go either. We can’t simply deny the way we feel, any more than we can deny our desire to be loved, be liked, and enjoy our food. What I’m saying is that we need to find a balance between subjective and objective thinking.<br> Finding a balance will help us deal with our weight problem, and help us to feel more comfortable socializing with others in situations that involve food. It’s not impossible, but it can initially seem a bit cumbersome. I found that I had to consciously think my way through it at first. Sometimes I still need to consciously achieve a balance in my thinking, so I don’t get myself too worked up.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> Child to an Adult</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Socializing is all about our need to interact and to be liked by others. Our greatest fear is rejection. As a fat person, I faced rejection many times. If you’re fat, you know exactly what I’m talking about. However, it’s important to remember that we choose to be fat and we can choose to be thin. It’s not a surprise to us that, as a fat person, we will face some rejection, so, in some way, we choose that rejection. Here’s an interesting question: Why would anyone choose to be rejected? There could be any number of reasons and, as I’ve said before, I’m not a therapist of any sort, so I’m really not qualified to answer that question. However, I have been in that position and I can tell you that some part of me didn’t want to be accepted by the group. I think it has something to do with my home environment while I was growing up. Now, I could sit here and whine about all the problems my parents inflicted on me, but if I did, I would still be fat and facing rejection. I would just be living in victim mode and clinging to that pain to keep me company. Not only that, but I would also be living like a child, carrying around all the hurts I’ve ever faced. At a certain point, it is time to be your own person and start acting like an adult. The key word is not adult—the key word is act, because it’s time to take action. That’s how adults face their problems.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Relationship Dynamics</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> When it comes to people you know well, you may have to face some challenges. I knew of a couple, the husband was thin and the wife was fat. The husband would buy his wife chocolates because he liked his wife fat. Why he liked his wife fat, I don’t know. I have my own theories about his insecurities, but really I don’t know. He may have been a food pusher. All I know is that he bought the chocolates and his wife ate the chocolates—remember, no one can force an adult to do anything. People can talk about social pressure and all kinds of other bullshit, but the bottom line is: if you don’t want to do something, you don’t have to. Perhaps their relationship wasn’t the healthiest, but there was something there that worked for both of them.<br> Now, imagine if, one day, the woman said no to her husband’s chocolates, what then? Well, I think it’s pretty obvious that her refusal of the chocolates would throw a wrench into the dynamic. A refusal like that would mean that something would have to change. Either the husband would have to get used to the fact that his wife no longer wanted his chocolates and to be fat, or the wife would have to change her mind and accept the chocolates. Now, the husband may accept that his wife no longer wants his gifts of chocolates, but he may not like it. If he is unhappy with his wife’s refusal of the chocolates, chances are he’s going to express it. Nothing exists in a vacuum. Until this point, from his view, his wife was happy to accept his chocolates, so now he feels rejected. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Berries</strong> are tiny colorful fruits that are packed full of fiber,minerals and vitamins. Although there are a lot of different kinds, among the most popular ones are blueberries, strawberries,blackberries, and raspberries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Berries are known to contain some antioxidants called anthocyanins.These substances have anti-inflammatory effects that will lower yourrisk of inflammation and disease. Your body&#8217;s immune system comprises of natural killer cells &#8211; NK cells &#8211; which help keep your body system functioning properly. Studies have shown that men and women who consumed berries had lower levels of certain inflammatory markers associated with inflammatory diseases</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg" alt="Fish" class="wp-image-576" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">.<br> ● <strong>Fish</strong> are a great source of protein. Everybody knows this.They also long-chains of omega-3 fatty acids. Although all types of fish contain some amount of omega-3 fatty acids, salmon, herring,mackerel, sardines, and anchovies are among the best sources. These kinds of fish are known to reduce inflammation that can cause metabolic syndrome, hepatitis, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.<br> When you eat fish, your body system breaks down these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have antiinflammatory effects. During clinical research, people consuming salmon or omega-3 fatty acid supplements had decreases in certain inflammatory markers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg" alt="Broccoli " class="wp-image-577" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Broccoli </strong>First of all, broccoli is highly nutritious. It is a cruciferous vegetable, along with some other veggies like cauliflower, brussels sprouts and kale. Studies have shown that consuming a generous amount of cruciferous veggies has been linked with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer.<br> This is believed to be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain. Broccoli also contains sulforaphane, an antioxidant that reduces inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and other proinflammatory substances which drive inflammation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg" alt="Avocados " class="wp-image-578" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Avocados </strong>Accept it. Avocado is a superfood worthy of the title. I never liked avocados growing up. They were green and tasted weird. But I discovered certain benefits of avocados and put some work into trying out various recipes I might like. I discovered a few but trust that there are certain ways I will never eat an avocado.<br> They are filled with potassium, magnesium, fiber and healthy monounsaturated fats, and they also contain certain compounds called carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to the reduction of cancer risks. In addition, certain compounds in avocados may reduce inflammation in young skin cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In one study, people were asked to consume a slice of avocado with a hamburger. After a period of time, it was discovered that they had lower levels of the inflammatory markers than participants who ate just the hamburger.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg" alt="Green tea" class="wp-image-579" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Green tea</strong> Everybody drinks one green tea or another these days.I don&#8217;t blame them,It has immense benefits. You&#8217;ve probably heard that green tea is one of the healthiest drinks you can take. It is known to reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, obesity and other inflammatory problems. Many of its benefits are due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances it contains, especially a substance known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).EGCG reduces inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. It also prevents damage to the fatty acids in your cells. Varieties of green teas can be found in stores all around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg" alt="Peppers" class="wp-image-580" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Peppers</strong> don&#8217;t exactly feel or taste pleasant. Despite the flavour they add to certain meals, they are known for a signature burn, some more than others. They have anti-inflammatory properties and that make them an essential in our diet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bell peppers and chili peppers are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants that inhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Bell peppers contain the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce at least one marker of oxidative damage in people with an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis. Chili peppers contain compounds like sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which can reduce inflammation and lead to more life expectancy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg" alt="Mushrooms" class="wp-image-581" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Mushrooms </strong>are those adorable little umbrella plants that are believed to house pixies and while hundreds of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible. Others are poisonous.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trick to being able to differentiate between good mushrooms and bad mushrooms lies somewhere on Google. You should find it. To save you the trouble, the good mushrooms include truffles,portobello mushrooms, and shiitake.<br> Mushrooms are considered to be very low in calories but rich in selenium, copper and the entire B vitamin family. They are also packed with phenols and other antioxidants that provide antiinflammatory aid. A special kind of mushroom called lion&#8217;s mane may potentially reduce the low-grade inflammation seen in obese individuals. Also, one study found that cooking mushrooms lowered their anti-inflammatory compounds so it may be best to eat them raw.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg" alt="Grape" class="wp-image-582" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Grape </strong>Round, beautiful, tasty and apparently, anti-inflammatory.Grapes contain substances like anthocyanins which reduce inflammation. Also, they can decrease the risk of several diseases,including heart problems, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and some eye disorders.<br> Grapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol, another substance known for its many health benefits. In one study, people with heart problems consumed grape extract daily and experienced a significant decrease in inflammatory gene markers. Another interesting fact is that their levels of adiponectin increased. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg" alt="Turmeric " class="wp-image-583" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Turmeric </strong>is a yellow or orange spice with a strong,earthy flavor that is often used in curries and other Indian dishes. It has received a lot of attention for its content of the powerful antiinflammatory substance called curcumin. Turmeric is proven to be effective at reducing the inflammation related to hepatitis, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Turmeric is THE superfood of superfoods!<br> A study showed that one gram of curcumin everyday mixed with piperine from black pepper caused a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP in people with metabolic syndrome. The problem however is that it may be hard to get enough curcumin to have a noticeable effect from just turmeric. It needs to be combined with other substances to get the full experience. In one study, obese women who took 2.8 grams of turmeric everyday had no improvement whatsoever in inflammatory markers.<br> If you can&#8217;t seem to find anything to combine turmeric with, taking supplements containing isolated curcumin is also effective.<br> Curcumin supplements are usually combined with piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by a lot! Turmeric is also used as a face mask for skin inflammation, but it is not as effective on its own as it will be when mixed with other things like milk, lemon, honey, oatmeal, and so on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1.jpg" alt="Extra virgin olive oil" class="wp-image-584" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong>, is one of the healthiest kinds of fat you can eat. It is rich in monounsaturated fats and an essential in the Mediterranean diet, which provides immense health benefits. Research links extra virgin olive oil to a significantly reduced risk of heart disease, brain cancer and other major health conditions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lovely green goodness<br> In one Mediterranean diet study, some inflammatory markers significantly decreased in those who consumed 50 ml of olive oil daily. The effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, can been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or diclofenac. Don&#8217;t forget that anti-inflammatory benefits are much greater in extra virgin olive oil than in more refined olive oils. It&#8217;s very easy to find extra virgin olive oil in your neighbourhood grocery store, but you can also buy it online.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg" alt="Dark chocolate" class="wp-image-585" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Dark chocolate</strong> Chocolate as an anti-inflammatory food? Oh yeah! Dark chocolate is absolutely delicious, rich, satisfying and a way for life for some good folks like myself. It is also loaded with antioxidants that reduce inflammation. Dark chocolate can actually reduce your risk of inflammation and heart disease.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dark chocolate! My precioussssss.<br>
Flavanols &#8211; the anti-inflammatory substance in dark chocolate &#8211; are responsible for chocolate&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effects and keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy. In one clinical study, smokers experienced significant improvement in endothelial function few hours after eating chocolate that&#8217;s high in flavonol. Make sure to always choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa -more is always better &#8211; in order to get the anti-inflammatory benefits.<br>
You can buy that chocolate bar now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg" alt="Tomatoes " class="wp-image-586" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Tomatoes </strong>The tomato is another superfood. It is high in nutrients and has many healing properties include fixing sunburns!<br> Tomatoes are very high in vitamin C, potassium and lycopene, the antioxidant with impressive anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is also particularly beneficial for reducing pro-inflammatory compounds related to several kinds of cancer.<br> Clinical studies have determined that drinking tomato juice significantly decreased inflammatory markers in overweight women.<br> It doesn&#8217;t work as much in obese women though.Cooking tomatoes in olive oil can maximize the amount of lycopene available for absorption. What did you expect from the combination of two very powerful anti inflammatory foods? Tomatoes can be eaten raw or cooked. They&#8217;re a key component of pasta sauce, vegetable salad,sandwiches and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg" alt="Cinnamon " class="wp-image-587" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Cinnamon </strong>is a very delicious spice with a distinctive smell. It contains a compound called cinnamaldehyde which is responsible for inhibiting certain proteins such as actin and C-reactive protein, which can lead to inflammation.<br> Cinnamaldehyde also works by stopping unwanted agglutination of blood platelets that can lead to inflammation by sending signals for the release of arachidonic acid and reducing the formation of thromboxane A2. Too much cinnamon may cause breathing difficulties so take it in moderation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1.jpg" alt="Ginger " class="wp-image-588" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ginger-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Ginger </strong>Apart from being a delicious addition to a wide range of meals, ginger is stacked with a lot of health benefits beyond inflammation. It is known to improve metabolism and help fight oxidative damage. Studies have shown that the compounds gingerol and zingerone found in ginger are solely responsible for the root&#8217;s ability to fight inflammation. They have been linked to reductions in many forms of inflammation, from colitis to kidney damage to diabetes and hepatitis.<br> The absolute best way to consume ginger is to eat the raw root.Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. Although it may be difficult for your body to break down the fiber, it is the best way to get all the anti-inflammatory substances absorbed into your body. However, for the faint of heart, it is also available in powder and supplement form.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lots of us believe that we eat our feelings and <em>need to get some control goddammit</em>. But what is actually even more common, and way more detrimental, is using <em>dieting and control</em> to numb our feelings.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dieting is one of the big ways we try to avoid feeling our bodies. It is a perfect storm of distraction, control, perfectionism, and the chemical high we get from adrenaline and other stress hormones when we restrict our food.Dieting is a way to disconnect us from our bodies and stifle our life force. <em>Less</em> food and <em>higher</em> stress hormones help us temporarily live with less feeling, not to mention all of the concentration and focus it takes to override your appetite and famine response. Dieting is a distraction.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">All of the following tools and exercises are devoted to help you begin feeling. You are going to be doing enough work on habitually feeling emotions, and when you do that, emotional eating will lose its power. When you are committed to feeling emotions, the coping mechanisms you’ve used naturally begin to take a healthier role in your life.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We become dysfunctional with food, and it’s not usually because of emotional eating at all. It’s because of restriction, guilt, and the biological survival cycle that it induces—and also because of our deep fear of weight and taking up space. As long as you are getting out of reactive famine mode, <em>and</em> learning to feel instead of numb, you don’t need to worry about emotional eating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do not get stuck in the trap of worrying that you need to stop emotionally eating—that will become restriction. Just eat and feel. I also want to remind you that eating is never a problem in and of itself. Shift your attention instead to making sure you aren’t trying to numb or distract yourself with control, perfectionism, and <em>dieting</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s also important to note that emotional eating and bingeing aren’t the same thing. In all of my experience working with so many, manyyyy people who believed that emotional eating was their problem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. once they stopped restricting, they were able to see that emotional eating was not actually their <em>core</em> problem at all. Emotional eating is not the reason most people are so dysfunctional with food. The problem is the biological famine response and the yo-yo of restriction, which leads to bingeing. That is the thing to fix if you want to become normal with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even if you worry that you tend to eat to numb, the answer is still never to restrict, because that will just start up the yo-yo again. In the physical part of the process (and always) the answer is eating. The answer now is also feeling.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The truth is, eating emotionally is actually perfectly healthy and normal. All humans eat emotionally. Your cravings and your body’s needs are directly affected by your mental state and your stress levels. You are <em>meant</em> to have the option to comfort yourself with food. You are not a robot eating battery pellets for energy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Food is fuel and nutrition, but it is also allowed to be comforting and grounding. And eating food to comfort and fill you up or to connect with others is a <em>nonissue</em> when you’re not in a reactive binge/repent cycle. When you are actually feeding yourself and trusting your body, <em>and</em> your body actually trusts that it is being fed, comfort eating can just be a part of a very normal relationship with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, eating birthday cake is an emotional reason to eat food: celebration. And eating a big bowl of macaroni and cheese when you are tired and sad is a legitimate way to comfort and feed yourself.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating will happen. It is part of being human. It is part of being a normal eater. It is part of assessing what we need in any given moment and trying to comfort ourselves. That will always be okay. The more neutral food becomes, the more your body will naturally, without thinking about it, balance and account for times when we eat emotionally or “more than we need.” That’s what a healthy balanced body and appetite does. You don’t need to do <em>anything</em> about it. Just eat. Just listen. Just trust that this eating thing <em>ain’t that deep</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating <em>is not bingeing</em>. The problem only comes when you feel guilty about emotional eating. <em>That</em> triggers the guilt-and-repent cycle: Feeling guilty for eating. Deciding to restrict a little to make up for it. Then all hell breaks loose. Then you’re back in the yo-yo. The bottom line is, don’t feel guilty about eating, because that will only perpetuate your dysfunction with food.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The everyday act of consuming food should never bring you a feeling of captivity or worry. In a supercharged life, food is to be enjoyed and savoured. Here, we walk to the unforced rhythms that come with a commonsense attitude towards food and a balanced approach to eating. Letting go of a rule-bound approach to eating will bring you a sense of freedom, but still allow you to commit to food choices that equate to vibrant health and longevity – and a life fully lived.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve pulled together a list here of the basic commonsense eating guidelines I live by. Instead of being motivated by the fear of negative consequences, why not try to implement one or more of these in your life?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aubergines-bio-cabbage-5205-1.jpg" alt="Post" class="wp-image-414"/></figure>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong> Eat mostly plants<br>Despite the vast differences in doctrine between the mainstream and alternative nutrition experts, the one thing we can all agree on is that eating plant foods is really good. I like to ensure that plant foods – such as nuts, seeds, fruits, grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa, buckwheat), fruits, sea vegetables, herbs and spices – make up the majority of my diet, with the greatest emphasis on seasonal vegetables and especially greens. I still enjoy animal products such as meat, eggs, fish, cheese, butter and ghee, but in smaller quantities.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>2</strong> Avoid processed foods where you can<br>Industrially produced foods that your ancestors wouldn’t comprehend are best eaten in small amounts. Any ingredient with a number, or a name that doesn’t register as ‘food’ when you read it, probably isn’t food. Stick to things that are foods, in as natural a state as possible. If a laboratory or factory has done most of the preparation, it’s probably better to leave it on the supermarket shelf.</td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cake-1571747_1280-1.jpg" alt="Post" class="wp-image-359"/></figure>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>3</strong> Live by the 80:20 rule<br>Sticking to your nutritional values 80 per cent of the time will allow you a healthy margin where you can say yes to the chocolate cake at your friends’ birthday parties, or enjoy a big slab of pizza as you travel through Naples. There are food opportunities in life that just can’t be ignored or turned down. Don’t be that killjoy. Allowing yourself the space to stray from your regular nourishing eating habits will help you not to take yourself too seriously, and will bring freedom to your social food situations. Twenty per cent indulgence won’t do you any harm if you’re otherwise healthy.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>4</strong> Balance out your eating<br>Eating is all about balance. If you’ve been out of your normal routine while at work or on holidays and found you’ve overindulged in a specific food, spend the next few days nourishing yourself back to homoeostasis (metabolic balance) with the foods you’ve been missing. If you’ve spent a few days eating lots of starchy, cooked foods, for example, it might be a good idea to spend a couple of days eating some raw and lighter foods through vegie juices, salads and vegetable soups.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>5</strong> Take an Ayurvedic approach<br>Traditional  Ayurvedic medicine teaches us that we attain health when we eat a practical balance of different types of foods from the taste categories of bitter, sweet, sour, salty, astringent and pungent.Having a varied diet of different tastes,eating seasonally, and ensuring the right balance of cooked and cold foods helps the nervous system recognise nourishment. You can work out your ideal Ayurvedic eating plan by determining your dosha, which will help you eat in a commonsense way for your unique body type.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>6</strong> Choose quality over quantity<br>This is especially true with animal products. Overall, try to invest in better-quality food that’s chemical-free or organic. Shop at local farmers’ markets rather than supermarkets if possible. With animal products, look for organic or 100 per cent grass-fed and grass-finished. It’s better to enjoy smaller amounts of quality food than gorging on food that’s cheap and of lower quality.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Unplug, turn off the TV, sit at the table, use proper dinnerware, eat with friends and family, and give thanks. Tune in to all your senses and pay attention to enjoying and savouring each glorious mouthful. Enjoy the following morning and afternoon tea delights.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In a supercharged kitchen, true nourishment begins. There’s so much potential, wherever you live, to create memories of love and hospitality that will linger in the imagination of your family and friends. The kitchen is where your food culture is established, where you decide on and store the kinds of ingredients you wish to share with your loved ones. You can either have a pantry full of pre-packaged foods, or a wondrous landscape of individual, fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients waiting to be combined into fulfilling, wholesome meals.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Many people find the kitchen a stressful place to be; some even despise cooking, preferring to fork out money for a convenient takeaway meal. The problem with this is you’re not just paying for the food, you’re paying for a business. The way many restaurant and take away businesses make their money is by minimizing expenditure to increase their profit margin; in other words, they buy cheap, low-quality ingredients, make them taste good by coating them in additive-laden sauces and seasonings, then sell each dish at a price that allows their staff, rent and bills to be paid, with some extra on top for the business owners. I’d much rather put my money towards quality, ethically produced ingredients sourced from local producers and farmers’ markets, add a little kitchen work and enjoy a meal that’s better on my wallet, better for the planet, and better for my body and my family. You? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Food is at the heart of the home, and cooking is the vehicle to ensure a healthier and happier society. Michael Pollan famously addresses what he calls ‘a curious paradox’ around food in his book Cooked, where he observes that his fellow Americans seem to be devoting more time to thinking about food than ever before. An increasing interest in TV shows about food and cooking coincides with a collective disengagement from real food and the act of cooking in the home. With more meals prepared outside the home thanks to industrial food production, it seems the less Americans cook, the more interesting they find food and its preparation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> If we’re so transfixed by cooking that we spend hours gazing at, thinking about and observing it in the media, why as a society do we value our own kitchens so little? It’s time we began to fall in love with the instinctive, natural, utterly human behaviour of cooking once again, and we can only fall in love with our kitchens when we rekindle our love for food. Food is central to the seven keystones of life, as discussed earlier, and this is where we need to begin our food safari – in the heart of the home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> At this point in history, we seem busier than ever. We outsource everything, including our food preparation. The definition of ‘cooking’ for the modern man or woman appears to include taking out a packet of pre-made ravioli and pre-made pasta sauce, heating them up and covering them with pre-grated cheese. This is a far cry from the home preparation of stocks, breads and other foods that our great-grandparents would have been involved in daily.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Previous generations were raised knowing where their food came from. They probably visited or lived on the farms where their fruit and vegetables grew, maybe even picked them from their own backyard, preserving the excess bounty as jams and pickles to be eaten in the months that followed. Not yet dictated to by a global market, they would have eaten seasonally, knowing that winter is a time for grounding root vegetable stews, and that spring brings the sweetest green peas and juicy lamb chops. Sadly for 21st-century generations, we’ve completely lost touch with our earth’s seasonal wisdom and how it provides our body with exactly the nutrients and life forces it needs to flourish through the extremes.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the first places to begin your kitchen adventure and love affair with food and ingredients is your humble spice rack. It can rapidly become your most loyal supporter in the kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A spice rack serves as a kaleidoscopic palette of flavoursome dried herbs and spices that will impart specific flavours to your cooking. These spices can be paired or used on their own to complement your culinary creations.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To set up a do-it-yourself spice rack or spice drawer, it all comes down to the space you have in your kitchen and what will be most practical for you. Many homeware stores sell rectangular storage baskets that can slide in and out of your pantry or cupboards and be filled with spices.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">You could also recycle a wooden box as a home for your spice collection. You could keep the spices in their original packaging, and if they’re in packets invest in some kitchen storage bag clips to reseal them after opening. This will stop any spills that make your cupboards smell like a curry house!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have plenty of shelf space or a large walk-in pantry, you could dedicate a shelf to spices, using small screw-top preserving jars or little spring-clip jars for storage. This is an ideal way to store spices, as it saves you fiddling through a spice box or drawer, which can become disorganised very easily. Because my kitchen is the hub of my home and I spend a lot of time creating recipes, I have all my spices in alphabetical order for ease of use, but you don’t have to go that far!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A handy thing to do is buy a jar for every spice you use, and use a labeller or a permanent marker to clearly indicate which spice is which. Many spices are a similar colour, so good labelling will save you a lot of time trying to find what you need.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having your spices in glass jars will allow you to see which ones you need to top up before they actually run out. Depending on the way you like your kitchen to look, stacked rows of jars along a shelf can be both stylish and practical.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take a fresh look at salads and you’ll see there are a lot of exciting developments in the salad bowl. Banished forever is the image of salads as dull diet food consisting of little more than limp lettuce and soggy, flavorless tomatoes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today, salads are one of the ultimate health foods. They can contain an exciting variety of colorful, delicious, and satisfying ingredients that provide the nutrients essential for healthy living. Remember, salads aren’t just for summer. We have plenty of ideas for salads that brighten and lighten winter mealtimes, too. In fact, once you get into the habit of thinking “salad” while menu planning, ideas will also come to you whatever the time of the year as you push your shopping cart along the supermarket aisles or stop at the cheese counter or produce department.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
are versatile enough to cater for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Meat,
seafood, and poultry are ideal salad ingredients, along with the perhaps more
commonly used lettuce and other leaves, vegetables, fruit, herbs, nuts, seeds,
grains, legumes, and cheese. And with so many ingredients to choose from,
salads can be as simple and light or complex and filling as you like. They also
have the added bonus that they are versatile enough to fit easily into all your
meal plans, from first courses through to desserts.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of </p>

you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of
chicken salad doesn’t excite because you’ve been making the same recipe out of
habit for as long as you can remember, try Thai-Style Chicken Salad. You’ll
never think of chicken salad as humdrum again!</p>



<h1>Bowls of Goodness</h1>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It
wasn’t long ago that when “salads” and “health” were linked it was in the
context of weight-reducing diets that were restrictive and ultimately
unsatisfying. Today, however, salads are a delicious component of a healthy
diet, giving you endless variety at mealtimes without long hours in the
kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">With
fresh produce from all corners of the globe readily available in supermarkets
and gourmet food stores, you can enjoy a variety of salads all year round but,
remember, salads are at their most flavorsome and nutritious when made with
seasonal produce in its prime.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We
are all being urged to eat more fruit and vegetables every day, and a salad a
day can go a long way to help you meet the minimum target of 2½ cups for
adults. Enjoy a bowl of Traditional Greek Salad or Three-Color Salad, for
example, and you’ll be more than halfway to success. What could be easier—or
more enjoyable?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
also make great accompaniments, served alongside a filling bowl of pasta or a
plate of hot or cold roast meat.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green leaves with a simple oil-and-vinegar dressing, it’s definitely time to think again. And don’t make the mistake of thinking all salad ingredients have to be raw, either. Adding small amounts of cooked meat, poultry and seafood to lettuce leaves and other vegetables gives you a satisfying meal. If you want a meal-in-a-bowl, try Roast Pork with Pumpkin, Smoked Chicken Salad with Avocado &amp; Tarragon Dressing, and Shrimp &amp; Rice Salad, for example. There are plenty of vegetarian main-course salads, too, such as the Middle Eastern favorite Tabbouleh and Buckwheat Noodle Salad with Smoked Tofu.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cooked vegetables also make good salad ingredients. Grilled peppers, fried eggplants, blanched beans of all varieties, and peas are just some of the cooked vegetables.</p>
