					<description><![CDATA[The word ‘ketogenic’ originated from ‘ketones,’ from which ‘keto’ is derived.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast.jpg" alt="appetizer-avocado-breakfast" class="wp-image-1297" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appetizer-avocado-breakfast-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> The word ‘ketogenic’ originated from ‘ketones,’ from which ‘keto’ is derived. Ketones are a small fuel molecule used as an alternative to providing sugar in the body when glucose (blood sugar) is short in supply. When you are low on carbs, your body goes through a metabolic state known as ketosis.</p>



<p> Ketosis is characterized by a rise in the level of ketones in the system. Here you start burning glucose due to the lack of energy. Keto diets, unlike other low-carb diets, are centered on this macronutrient which supplies about 90% of the body&#8217;s calories. Ketones are created from fats, and they provide energy to the whole body, particularly to the brain. The brain is the powerhouse of the human body, and it is always working. Even when you are asleep.</p>



<p> However, it cannot run directly on fat, unless it gets converted into either glucose or ketones.</p>



<p> Whenever there is a drop in the level of insulin in your body, the amount of fat that your system burns spikes because the stored fats become more accessible and make it easier for your body to utilize them. It is a fact that burning fat is one of the easiest ways to shed a few pounds. </p>



<p> This process is also beneficial for the body, in the sense that it gives you enough energy and reduces the number of times that you get hungry and helps you stay alert and focused throughout the day. When you are on a keto diet, your body begins to run on fat all day long, so it is perfect for getting your weight under your control since it burns fats 24/7.</p>



<p> Once you have decided to go on a keto diet, you should avoid too much protein because it can easily interfere with ketosis. That’s why you need to employ some tricks, as well as a conscious effort, to get the results you desire. </p>



<p> For instance, you must eat very low levels of carbohydrates in a day. Keep in mind that there are foods with extremely high levels of carbs, e.g., banana. There are about 27 grams of carbs in a medium sized banana. </p>



<p> When you start on a keto diet, you should also remember that reaching ketosis does not take place overnight. Retraining your liver to produce ketones is not an easy feat. It typically takes a few days to get to this metabolic state.</p>



<p> In summary, the keto diet is a low-carbohydrate diet, which is used to burn fat more easily and quickly by allowing you to consume more fats than carbohydrates. It follows a dietary plan of about 60 to 70% fat, 15 to 30% protein, and 5 to 10% carbs (Perfect Keto, n.d.).</p>



<p> Generally, it is considered to be safe for almost everybody, but there are some groups of people to whom special consideration should be given. Those on medication for diabetes or hypertension, as well as mothers that are breastfeeding, should consult with their doctor before starting any diet or lifestyle changes.</p>

<p> You can minimalize your kitchen in several ways. Among them, you can spend a whole day, or if you have little time you can use these recommendations which will take you not more than 15 minutes a day to accomplish. Below, we will show you how to minimalize your kitchen step by step. </p>



<h3> <strong>Step 1: Start in The Pantry</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg" alt="pantry" class="wp-image-1176" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pantry-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://www.playtalklearn.com/">playtalklearn.com</a>  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Start by reviewing the due dates and throw away everything that you will not be able to use before the due dates. Then review what has not expired and keep only what you’ll really use within their shelf life. It’s time to go! Throw them out! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 2: Refrigerator and Freezer</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg" alt="organizing my fridge" class="wp-image-1059" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Repeat the steps of the pantry for the refrigerator and freezer. Do not forget to clean every space that you are going to minimize. There is something about seeing a clean space, which makes you think about what you are going to put there. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 3: Plastic Containers</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg" alt="Containers" class="wp-image-1183" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Containers-1-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcrecycles/4074783459">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>  By minimizing your containers, just like crockery. It is important to take into account how many are in the house and how many are used. This will help you not to get rid of anything that you really need. Besides that, it will give you the opportunity to keep those that you really use and inspire you. For some reason, it is one of the elements that seem to multiply by themselves. </p>



<p> Once you know what you use and how many of it you need, it&#8217;s time to get rid of the rest. There is no need to have thousands of useless containers in your space. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 4: Pots and Pans</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg" alt="Pots and Pans" class="wp-image-1178" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pots-and-Pans-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/r4andred/511125951/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Once again, think about the preparations you make to know what utensils you actually use. You will see that you hardly really need that collection of pots of all sizes. By now you already know what to do with the ones you don’t need. </p>



<h3><strong> Step 5: Molds for Oven</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg" alt="Molds" class="wp-image-1163" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Molds-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> With the preparations you usually make in mind; be honest with yourself and keep those molds that you will truly use. </p>



<p> Do not kid yourself thinking that maybe later you might need some of these.<br> The reality is that if you have not used it until now (or only once) there is not much chance that you will need it. As it is something sporadic it is better to borrow it and save yourself having it saved all your life just for that one time. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 6: Crockery</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg" alt="crockery" class="wp-image-1177" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crockery-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> How many are in the house? This is the fundamental question to minimize your tableware. You do not need 15 dishes if there are only 3 in the house for example. </p>



<p> Maybe you wonder what I do when I receive visitors? Well, simple. Make sure to have a package of cardboard plates and cutlery in case of having visitors. Not only will it save you space, but you will not have to wash off more when someone comes. </p>



<h3><strong>Step 7: Cutlery and Ladles</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg" alt="Cutlery and Ladles" class="wp-image-1180" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cutlery-and-Ladles-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p> Like crockery, you do not need more than the number of people in the house.<br> Why do you have a drawer full of forks, spoons, and knives when in reality you only use a couple of each? </p>



<h3><strong>Step 8: Home Appliances</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg" alt="Home Appliances" class="wp-image-1181" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1.jpg 725w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Home-Appliances-1-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></figure></div>



<p> A secret that can help you keep your kitchen clear is &#8211; try to use your utensils in more ways than one. And this applies to each of the previous points as well. </p>



<p> By minimizing the number of appliances you have, you not only clear your kitchen and simplify your life, but you have the opportunity to sell what you do not use and make some money in the attempt. </p>



<p> Keep what you really use, do not keep things thinking of a day you will use it. Get rid of kitchenware tools you do not need after separating the things you really use! </p>



<h3><strong>Step 9: Others</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg" alt="kitchenware" class="wp-image-1182" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenware-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97226447@N00/7412770556/">flickr.com</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>

Some kitchenware tools like a chopping board, drainer, and potatoes peeler, among others can come handy on a good day.<br> You do not have to love cooking, but it should not be a torture either. The fewer utensils you have, the less time you spend washing, organizing and cleaning. You will see that it becomes more bearable when everything handy.

					<description><![CDATA[When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-Zones.jpg" alt="Kitchen Zones" class="wp-image-1194"/></figure></div>



<p>For decades, most people had embraced the idea of arranging their kitchen using the “kitchen-triangle” layout. The layout had a particular position for the sink, refrigerator, and stove. They were organized in a way that a person wouldn’t need to take several steps before accessing any of the areas. There are some kitchens that still use this layout to this day. However, with the evolution of the kitchen space, this layout no longer applies to large kitchens.</p>



<p> When organizing your kitchen, layout is an important consideration since it will determine the respective work zones you will have. Whether large or small, every kitchen should have at least three different working zones.<br> Common zones that you should expect in any kitchen include the cooking zone, cleaning zone, and the storage zone. Understanding the purpose of these zones guarantees that you organize your kitchen in the best way possible. This chapter takes a closer look at how these zones should look.</p>



<h2> The Prep Zone</h2>



<p> Just as the name suggests, this is the area where you prepare yourself to cook.<br> There are several activities that you can do including washing, slicing, peeling, chopping, and draining right before the actual cooking begins. When baking, there are many activities that will take place before the cooking begins. It is vital that you move from one zone to the other systematically when cooking. Usually, these zones will overlap.</p>



<p> It’s important to have sufficient space to conduct all the activities that take place in the prep zone. For that reason, you should consider uncluttering the kitchen counters here. Also, you should utilize the storage spaces in the prep zone wisely to ensure that you minimize overlapping from one end to the other. Use the storage strategy where you store items based on usage.</p>



<p> The prep zone will have a few cabinets for you to store what you will use during meal preparation. Make sure that your organization creates room for accessibility. Don’t store unwanted things in these cabinets because other cabinets are full. Everything in your kitchen has its home. If not, then consider storing in your junk drawer or donating.</p>



<h2> The Cooking Zone</h2>



<p> The cooking zone will feature a number of things around your kitchen including the stove cooktop and several appliances that you use most often.<br> The warming drawer or a microwave will be found here. Also, keep in mind that breakfast is a common meal to most people, and a toaster or coffee maker could also be found in the cooking zone. Stocking the cooking zone should be done appropriately. This means that the drawers and cabinets in this section should be used for cooking purposes. You should store baking pans, utensils, pots, cookie sheets, etc. in these storage spaces.</p>



<h2>The Cleaning Zone</h2>



<p> Depending on the size of your kitchen, there are several cleaning zones that you will have in your kitchen. Regardless, this area is usually in close proximity with the sink. The trash bins are also part of this zone because they are the sections that help in keeping your kitchen free from dirt. The cooking process will begin and end here. Before preparing any meal, you will have to wash the ingredients. Once you are done eating, it’s in the cleaning zone where you will wash the dirty dishes.</p>



<p> The cleaning area should not be far from the cooking zone or the prep zone.<br> In fact, larger kitchens can have several sinks next to the prep area for convenience purposes. It should also be noted that it can be a great idea to position the washing area close to a window. This provides you with natural ambience to enjoy while cleaning the dishes. Ideally, this can be a great place to cool off your mind and enjoy a healthy conversation with anyone giving you company as you clean.</p>



<h2> The Storage Zone</h2>



<p> This is one major area that will have a profound impact on how your kitchen looks. Failure to use the storage area appropriately can ruin the good look of your kitchen. Your kitchen might appear spacious, but if things are not stored in their right places you might feel suffocated.</p>



<p> There are numerous storage ideas that you can utilize to give your kitchen a simplified yet comprehensive look. Some of these hacks are succinctly discussed in the following lines.</p>



<p> <strong>Pull-Out Pantries</strong><br> If you’ve been to a kitchen with pull-out pantries, then you know these storage spaces are indeed worth having in any modern kitchen. The exciting aspect of this storage space is that when you pull out the pantry drawer, you will gain access to multiple shelves. This means that you have more space within a single unit. The idea can be incorporated into your cabinets.</p>



<p> <strong>Pull-Out Spice Racks</strong><br> The pull-out spice racks as similar to pull-out pantries. Their designs are different since they are meant to hold boxes and jars.</p>



<p> <strong>Shelves Next to Your Kitchen Windows</strong><br> There is a great frame effect that you get when you incorporate floating shelves into your kitchen. Contingent on your window size, you can design varying sizes of your storage components. These shelves should be used as storage spaces for dishes and other cookware that you use frequently.</p>



<p> <strong>Mug Racks</strong><br> There is something interesting about the mugs and cups we use for breakfast.<br> Most people have a personal attachment to their cups or mugs. It is for this reason that you will find folks using the same cup throughout the year. You should embrace the idea of hanging your favorite mugs and cups on hooks. A key issue to remember is that you should not make your kitchen crowded with these hangings. As such, limit the number of cups that you choose to hang.</p>



<p> <strong>Woven Storage Baskets</strong><br> There are certain spaces in your kitchen that will be unoccupied most of the time. They are called the kitchen islands. This space can be occupied by woven storage baskets. Doing this will help you create additional space that can hold items that don’t belong to the kitchen, such as your car keys or your smartphone.</p>



<p> There are many ways of creatively creating storage space around your kitchen. Your chosen technique should help in creating space and not crowding up the place. Therefore, you should settle for the best solutions which suit you.</p>



<p> Essentially, the importance of understanding the kitchen zones is that it aids in knowing what goes where in your kitchen. You cannot maintain an organized kitchen if you don’t know how its layout looks like. Also, this information is handy when one is looking to remodel their kitchen.</p>

<p> Living together with colleagues in the apartment can leave you with some hobbies such as not being able to stand the silence of an empty place, but also valuable teachings. You have to be very supportive of the customs, manners, and laziness of people.</p>



<p> If you are about to share your kitchen, you should try to make peace between you and your roommates. Therefore, not only will you have to maintain that relationship with them, but you will also need to take care of and maintain your minimalist style. In this chapter, you will find tips on how to make that possible.</p>



<h3>Tip #1: Divide the refrigerator and you will win</h3>



<p> When different people live in a house, the tastes are different. Maybe the refrigerator is always full of beers, or other things that perhaps you don’t really like. In case there is only one refrigerator, the best thing you can do is that each person has their own shelf. Also, it is better not to make everyone buy stuffs the same day. Doing so, the refrigerator and the pantry get stuck. You have to coordinate the days of purchase of each one.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Place your food in the fridge strategically</h3>



<p> The food that you leave near the refrigerator door is the one that finishes first. It is better to put it behind, but be careful that it will not be forgotten or it will be spoiled.</p>



<h3>Tip #3: Reach an agreement to consume only one type of milk</h3>



<p> Unless one is lactose intolerant, another vegan and one more prefers chocolate. It is better to have only one type of milk for everyone. Products like salt, sugar, and oil also work and less mess is made.</p>



<h3>Tip #4: Do not be afraid to throw out the outdated, even if it&#8217;s alien</h3>



<p> If you see a yogurt that is going to expire, it is best that you eat it, notify the owner and replenish it. If you detect that something has already broken down, throw it away. You do not even have to notice it; they forgot it for a reason.</p>



<h3>Tip #5: Wash that dirty rate from days ago; it does not matter if it&#8217;s from another</h3>



<p> Unwashed dishes create a mess and can be an important point of conflict. It is better everyone washes his dishes and there is no major problem. If you find something small like a glass or a spoon, nothing happens if you wash it. But if a person tends to leave what he uses without washing, it is best to talk to him about that.</p>



<h3>Tip #6: Hire a cleaning professional and divide the rate</h3>



<p> Using these services once or twice a week is the best and the payment is divided among all. In truth that makes things much simpler.</p>



<h3>Tip #7: Take turns to take out the organic trash</h3>



<p> There are many people who do not know how to separate trash and it is very important to have this skill. The best thing is to take the trash religiously on Saturday or another day. And, you have to make turns because nobody wants to take care of the organic trash. This is because it smells the worst and drips.</p>



<h4>How To Move Your Kitchen In The Fastest And Most Save Way?</h4>



<p> If you live in a rental and you are young, then changes are usually part of your life: moving to new countries, new jobs, and therefore, new floors are treaded on every day. So this is surely neither the first nor the last time.</p>



<p> Therefore, you can develop techniques or strategies to make this process less tedious, much more practical, quick and organized and make sure that you only take the essentials home to your kitchen.</p>



<h4>What Comes Before The Move?</h4>



<p> As you know a long time ago that you are going to move to your new apartment, you can begin a strong and complete declutter process.<br> It takes a couple of days trying to plan where your things will be located in<br> the new apartment. This is useful for two reasons.</p>



<ol><li>The first is that it allows you to plan now the flow of the move (what to take first and what to take later).</li><li>The second is that it helps you to practice the famous minimalist question: do I have a space to store it? If there is no space for something, then that something should not reach the new apartment.</li></ol>



<h4>Techniques For Moving Faster And Safer Way</h4>



<p> <strong>Technique #1: Make a list of your future needs</strong><br> Think about the needs that you will have in your new home: do you go to a smaller or larger house? In the city or in a town? Do you have exit to the outside or terrace? Is the weather warmer or cooler? Wet or dry? All this will help you to understand what kind of things you will need to take with you and which ones definitely should be left behind. Despite being a minimalist style, a kitchen consists of a number of different individual modules, countertops, accessories, and equipment.</p>



<p> For example, is the furniture in your old kitchen kept in good condition?<br> Calculate the costs of dismantling, transport, accessories (in most cases you have to change the countertops), assembly and possible installation work and wiring. In short, value the costs and risks of maintaining your old kitchen.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #2: Prepare this area in three parts: recycling, reuse and moving</strong><br> Especially clear this area to deposit objects that you neither need nor use for anything (recycling), those that you do not need but still have utility (reuse) and those that you need and you will take to your next home (move).</p>



<p><strong> Technique #3: Divide your objects by categories</strong><br> If you start to select objects without a specific order you will get tired and discouraged very quickly. To make this process more organized you can use a checklist (mentioned in technique #1).</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #4: Begin to select</strong><br> Select the items in the first category of the checklist in each of the three parts of the kitchen area (recycling, reuse, and removal). Then go to the next category, and the next, and the next to finish with the checklist. This is the first filter for a kitchen only with what is necessary and what you most want, so do not be sorry. Allow only items with these characteristics into your life and everything will be to your advantage: a minimalist kitchen from the beginning, less weight to carry and move, more space and order, etc.</p>



<p> We recommend making a list of pending and schedule pre-move tasks:</p>



<ul><li> Sort belongings</li><li> Organize what you will take.</li><li> Take recycling to the collection center.</li><li> Save what you are going to keep.</li><li> What should be left before the day of moving.</li><li> What to do on the day of the move</li></ul>



<p><strong>Technique #5: Recycle</strong><br> Gather all the objects in the recycling area and remember the infallible trick for your minimalist cleaning. Recycle your discarded belongings as soon as possible.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #6: Reuse</strong><br> Donate, give away or resell everything that is in good condition and may be needed by others. If you think there is something that can be useful to the next tenant (open cleaning products, brooms or mops, kitchen utensils), give it to him and write him a note so he knows he can use them.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #7: Start packing</strong><br> Pack by categories leaving out only what is necessary for the last days. Do not buy new boxes to keep. Sure, what you have at home already serves you (suitcases, large reusable shopping bags, plastic storage boxes, baskets, etc.).<br> Finally, do not forget to label the boxes so you will know where you have everything and it will be easier to find a specific item when you arrive at your new home.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #8: Organize in boxes what you are going to keep</strong><br> Prepare to save what you will keep and separate in boxes by priorities:</p>



<ul><li> <strong>High</strong>: What is very necessary and functional</li><li> <strong>Media</strong>: What you would like to unpack soon but which is not necessary.</li><li> <strong>Low</strong>: What is decorative</li></ul>



<p>This will allow you to unpack more peacefully and without haste.</p>



<p> <strong>Advice: Systematize the move</strong></p>



<ul><li> To make everything easier, differentiate the boxes.</li><li> Write down the space they belong to.</li><li> Assign a number by priority (1 is the highest priority).</li></ul>



<p> This way, once you arrive at your new home, you can take the boxes to their respective spaces and open only those that has the number 1 marked. Little by little you can open the others.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #9: And the day arrives! Organize your move</strong><br> If you have a moving service, congratulations! And if not, you have to load.<br> If you have an elevator, congratulations again! And if not, you have to load up the stairs (if any). To make everything more bearable, ask for help from friends and family and reward them with a good meal (after all who wouldn’t settle for a good meal?). In addition, this will help you to establish an organization system: first the largest furniture, then the small ones together with boxes and suitcases, and finally small objects to fill in the gaps.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #10: When everything is ready to go, clean</strong><br> When the van is full and the house empty, take advantage and do a good general cleaning. Nobody likes to find a dirty house, and although it sounds a bit weird. It will be good for you to spend some time alone with the house, say goodbye and think about this new stage in which you are embarking.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #11: When you get to your new home, do not unpack anything</strong><br> Yes, we know that this is the opposite of what is always said: it is important to unpack and place as soon as possible to get rid of it and continue with our lives. But, maybe not. Unpack little by little only what you need and miss and leave the rest untouched for up to a month. What you did not get out after that time, you probably do not need it.</p>

<p> We all use one knife or two on a regular basis either for their shape or grip without using the other knives.&nbsp;The idea&nbsp;is to keep a few knives, and&nbsp;replace them with another whenever needed instead of collecting a multi-kit do we don&#8217;t need.

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1453" width="452" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers.jpg 602w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pitchers-and-peelers-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></figure></div>



<p>These items don&#8217;t deserve to be found in the kitchen to be used seasonally or for rare occasions. You will not remember that you have them when you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>12. Over 18 Molds for Cupcakes or Muffins</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1452" width="563" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cupcakes-molds-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></figure></div>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 11. Wok</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Wok.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1164" width="563" height="319"/></figure></div>



<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need it to prepare satisfying oriental dishes. Unless you want to learn Chinese cooking, give it to the family that needs it or throw it out the window.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>10. Ice Cream Machine</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ice-Cream-Machine.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1165" width="563" height="373"/><figcaption>yourbestdigs.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It&#8217;s not worth the investment if you do not regularly make homemade ice cream. It is very little minimalist to have one.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong> 9. A Coffee Grinder or Spice Grinder</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1456" width="473" height="375" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder.jpg 630w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coffee-and-spice-grinder-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure></div>



<p>So, unless you use the grinder on a daily basis, it is best to simply buy quality pre-ground spices in small quantities so that they stay fresh and ready for your best dishes anytime you need them.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3> <strong>8. Cloths and Deteriorated Mittens</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Deteriorated-Mittens.jpg" alt="kitchen" class="wp-image-1167" width="563" height="321"/></figure></div>



<p>Usually at the bottom in the drawer accumulate the oldest rags, with some broken or impossible to remove. If you pull the ones that are on the top, it&#8217;s time to dig up the bottom ones and throw them away. Take advantage and check the mittens: if they are burned, say goodbye.<br> &#8220;It&#8217;s better to have 5 cloths in conditions that dry well than two dozen historic clothes,&#8221; says Gallay.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg" alt="kitchen-cleaning" class="wp-image-855" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> If you have a toddler and you think your kitchen is clean, all you need to do is turn around a few times, and your baby has probably found a way to find a new distraction causing another messy cleanup.</p>



<p> Let’s take a look at the kitchen cleaning methods and clean from the countertops to the kitchen floor.</p>



<h2> The Kitchen Sink:</h2>



<p> It’s time to tackle the kitchen sink. Just because you wash out the sink daily after you do a load of dishes, doesn’t mean it is clean. Water spots, rust, soap scum, and food stains can build up if you don’t stay ahead of them.</p>



<p> <strong>Porcelain Sinks:</strong> If you have a porcelain sink, you can make it gleam with this process:</p>



<ul><li>Line the sink with paper towels.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Soak them with bleach.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Let them soak for 30 minutes, and discard them.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Rinse the sink with hot running water.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Note</strong>: Don’t use bleach on colored porcelain because it will fade. Instead, use vinegar, baking soda, or a mild detergent (and a bit of elbow grease).</p>



<p> Now that you have the sink clean, you can protect it from scratches and stains by installing a plastic mat on the bottom of the sink. The mat will protect the shiny sink from lingering acidic foods/liquids such as salad dressing, vinegar, and fruit.</p>



<p><strong> The Garbage Disposal</strong>: If you smell something that seems rancid, it could be the garbage disposal needs some cleaning also. Simply, grind a few lemons in the unit to make it fresh and clean. Repeat the process every few weeks. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the drain for several hours before running the disposal. For a deeper clean, use this method for the garbage disposal drain:<br> What You Need:</p>



<p> ● White Vinegar (1 Cup)<br> ● Baking Soda (.5 cup)<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>The mixture will fizz (remember pop rocks candy from the 1970s) with a popping noise.</li><li>Wait a few minutes.</li><li>Pour boiling water down the drain.</li><li>Fill the drain with 2 cups of ice.</li><li>Pour one cup of salt in the drain over the ice cubes (rock salt or sea salt is a good choice if you have it).</li><li>Turn the cold-water faucet to the on position.</li><li>Turn on the disposal unit.</li><li>Run the disposal until the ice is gone.</li><li>The grime and debris should be loosened. Cut a lime or lemon in half and let the disposal chew them up for a deodorized drain.</li></ul>



<h2> Sanitizing the Sponges</h2>



<p> You can sanitize your sponge by tossing it into the microwave for ten to twenty seconds. It will kill all of the bacterial germs hiding in the nooks and crannies! Let them air dry thoroughly. Make an attempt to replace them every two weeks.</p>



<h2> Clean Small Appliances</h2>



<p> ● <strong>Toasters</strong>: Remove the crumbs from the toaster and toaster oven. Clean the racks with hot, soapy water to remove any food debris.<br> ● <strong>Can Opener</strong>: Take the opener apart and clean the cutter by soaking it in hot, soapy water. Scrub the blade with a scouring pad if necessary. Be careful, so you don’t get cut on the sharp blade.<br> ● <strong>The Blender</strong>: If you have ever tried to clean a blender, you know how involved the process can become. Simply add some soapy water in the blender, blend, rinse, and dry — no more hands on the sharp blades, or first aid kits necessary for the job.<br> ● Wipe all surfaces of the other small appliances.</p>



<h2>Clean the Microwave</h2>



<p> Remove any trays and wash them in hot, soapy water. Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe and scrub the entire unit. Be sure to spray the cleaner on the rag or sponge; not directly in the microwave.</p>



<p> You can also go the natural route with a few sliced lemons and a bowl of water in the microwave. Turn the unit on high until the microwave is steamy.<br> Let it steep for a few minutes to cut through the grease and grime. You can easily wipe out the moisture, and replace it with a fresh smelling space.</p>



<h2> Clean the Refrigerator</h2>



<p> Begin at the top of the refrigerator and remove everything. Clean out each shelf as you proceed. If any of the drawers or shelves are removable, take each unit out, and use warm soapy water to clean it. You want to clean every surface, especially the ones on the door—inside and out.</p>



<p> Before placing your food back inside of the fridge, line the shelves with some parchment paper or plastic food wrap to make cleaning a breeze. If you have a small mess, just remove the layer of plastic, and it is clean!</p>



<h2> Super-Clean the Oven</h2>



<p> Use natural products to clean the oven manually. You can choose from several techniques for general cleaning of your oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 1:</strong> Simply apply a layer of baking soda and spray it with a vinegar solution. It should form a paste. Leave the mixture on the surface of the oven for five minutes. Wipe the oven with a damp rag or sponge.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 2:</strong> First, take a look at one of the general natural cleaning options using baking soda:<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda<br> ● Water<br> ● Spray bottle<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Begin by spraying the oven with water, so it’s damp.</li><li>Sprinkle a ¼-inch layer of the soda, making sure you cover the entire surface.</li><li>If you see a dry spot, respray it with the water.</li><li>Let the mixture rest for at least three to four hours with the oven OFF.</li><li>Wipe the paste with an old towel to remove the grime.</li><li>It could take several applications, but thank goodness, it is natural.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 3:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, this will help remove the stuck-on grease and food.<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda (3 tbsp.)<br> ● Warm water (1 cup)<br> ● Castile soap (1 tbsp.)<br> Variations:<br> ● Lemon &amp; Clove: Add 5 drops each.<br> ● Lemon: Add 10 drops essential oil<br> ● Lemon &amp; Rosemary: Add 5 drops of each oil.<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Add all of the ingredients into a spray bottle. Shake well to mix.</li><li>To Use: Spray the oven liberally and let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li><li>Wipe it clean with a cloth or sponge. Rinse and let it air dry.</li><li>To Store: Store the leftovers for up to two weeks. Shake to<br> combine before using.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Manual Cleaning Ovens:</strong> <strong>Not Kid-Friendly:</strong> For tougher stains, you can use a commercial oven cleaner. You can also use a ½ cup of household ammonia.<br> Place the ammonia in a shallow pottery/glass container in the cold oven overnight. The burned-on food and grease will become loosened from the ammonia fumes.</p>



<p> Note: Don’t turn on the oven while the ammonia is inside of the oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Self-Cleaning Ovens:</strong> You are fortunate if you have a self-cleaning oven, but it also makes a mess with the ash left behind &#8211; similar to cigarette ashes. Clean up is simply wiping the ashes off the surfaces. If you don’t want to spend the extra time (anywhere from one to three hours) with an oven pumped up to 880 degrees; there is another way to clean those pesky spills.</p>



<p> <strong>Steam Cleaning Method: </strong>Choose the steam cleaning cycle which takes about 30 minutes.</p>



<ul><li>All you need to do is place one cup of water on the bottom of a cool oven.</li><li>Close the door and click the Steam Clean Cycle.</li></ul>



<p> The door won’t automatically lock, and it doesn’t involve any harsh chemicals. You also clean the racks while still in the oven. Wipe up the moisture and food debris and you are done!</p>



<p> <strong>Additional Helpful Usage Oven Tips:</strong></p>



<p> ● Never use commercial oven cleaners or liners of any type in or around any part of your self-cleaning oven.<br> ● Don’t use aluminum foil to catch any spillage.<br> ● Depending on the model the racks and pans might need to be removed. (Stainless steel must be removed.)</p>



<h2>Countertops &amp; The Backsplash</h2>



<p> Remove everything from the counters and thoroughly wipe down all of the surfaces using an all-purpose cleaner. Don’t forget the backsplash; it needs a good scrubbing also.</p>



<p> <strong>Special Countertops</strong><br> If you have white countertops, a cleaner with bleach included or soft-scrub (see the recipe) can be used for stubborn stains. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions, so you don’t damage the surfaces. These are the basics for four common countertops:</p>



<p> <strong>Stone Countertops: (Slate, Limestone, &amp; Soapstone):</strong><br> What You Need:<br> ● Warm, soapy water<br> ● A mild bleach solution<br> ● Or a non-abrasive cleaner</p>



<p> Note: Be sure to test a spot before you use anything other than warm, soapy water.</p>



<p> Grease Buildups: Use a mixture of white vinegar and water or an allpurpose cleaner.</p>



<p> You can also use a small brush such as a toothbrush to clean around the edges of the counters. Never use an abrasive pad because it will scratch the surface.</p>



<p> <strong>Butcher-Block Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> What You Need:</p>



<ul><li>Warm, soapy water</li><li>A mild bleach solution</li><li>A non-abrasive kitchen cleaner</li></ul>



<p> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Use a toothbrush along the edging to remove any debris.</li><li>If the surface feels tacky, use a baking soda and water paste.</li><li>Then, rinse thoroughly.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Ceramic Tile Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> You can use soap and water to clean ceramic tiles, but you need to be sure to rinse them thoroughly because soap can leave a filmy residue behind. Add some vinegar to the water to alleviate this issue. Never use an abrasive pad or cleaner.</p>



<p> Note: Even though the tile doesn’t stain easily—the grout will—with bacterial buildup as a result. Use a mild bleach solution and a toothbrush to clean the grout.</p>



<p> <strong>Concrete Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Clean the surface with warm and soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly.<br> You can use a mild bleach solution, but never use a scouring pad or abrasive cleaner on the surfaces.</p>



<p> For stubborn stains, you may also use talc mixed with a mixture of bleach, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste to the stained area, and use a soft brush to scrub the stain gently. Rinse thoroughly.</p>



<p> <strong>Marble Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Cleaning marble countertops is a bit different. It should be cleaned regularly with a soft, damp cloth (microfiber works well) to prevent streaks. Rinse it thoroughly to remove any residue. Wipe it dry because air drying can create water spots.</p>



<p> If acidic foods stain the surface such as wine, orange juice, or tomatoes; you may need to have the professionals clean the spot.</p>



<h2> The Cutting Board</h2>



<p> You have two choices to remove the leftover stains and smells on your cutting board using natural products. Use a lemon to scrub the board down.<br> You can also sprinkle some baking soda on the surface to remove some of the odors. Just rinse the board later and let it dry. You can also purchase plastic cutting boards that come in several colors for each type of food you would cut.</p>



<h2> Cabinets &#8211; Drawers &amp; Shelves</h2>



<p> Use a damp rag to clean any spills, spots, or splatters with an all-purpose cleaner. If you have wooden cabinets; use some Murphy’s Oil Soap, so the wood isn’t damaged. However, if the cabinets are new, it is best to ask the manufacturer or builder what works best on your particular cabinet.</p>



<p> <strong>Copper Pots</strong></p>



<p> Copper pots hanging in a kitchen makes it have a charming, homey effect.<br> Not only that, but it also saves a lot of space. However, you want to keep the surfaces shiny. Try one of these natural remedies that might surprise you:<br> ● <strong>Catsup</strong>: Give catsup a whirl; it will look really gross, but the acid will help cut through the tarnished surface.<br> ● <strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>: Pour some AC vinegar into a paper plate and let it soak. Rinse the pan and dry it completely.<br> ● <strong>Lemons &amp; Salt</strong>: Cut the lemon into wedges; dip a wedge into the salt, and rub the pan until it’s clean. Rinse the pan quickly and thoroughly in cold water, and wipe it dry.<br> ● <strong>Beer</strong>: Put some beer on the pot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes. Rinse and wipe it until dry and shiny.<br> ● <strong>Cottage Cheese</strong>: This is a cure that works without any scrubbing. Leave a layer of cottage cheese on the bottom for approximately five minutes. Rinse it completely and dry.</p>



<p> <strong>Stained Coffee Mugs:</strong></p>



<p> If you have stained coffee mugs, try this solution:<br> ● Also, try baking soda and water made into a paste.<br> ● This also works well on stained tea cups or coffee mugs, and even the cutting board.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/organizing-my-fridge.jpg" alt="organizing my fridge" class="wp-image-1059"/></figure></div>



<p> A fridge is an exceptional storage facility that will always help to ensure that your food is kept fresh for long. However, if you haven’t considered cleaning your fridge, there is a likelihood that you will have expired food stored in this appliance. This happens to many people as they throw fruit and veggies inside the fridge without proper organization. It is vital that you ensure you organize your fridge in a way that you will minimize waste by consuming what went in first.</p>



<p> Picture a scenario when you want to prepare a quick healthy snack on your way to work. What you want is to spend less time looking for ingredients.<br> With the right storage being used in the fridge, you can be sure that the appliance will serve its purpose in the best possible way.</p>



<p> Cleaning the fridge is an activity that shouldn’t be done only once in a year.<br> You should schedule a deep clean at least once every two months. Indeed, there are varying types of refrigerators out there. Regardless, there are various hacks you can utilize to make sure that it is always clean and tidy.</p>



<p> Prior to organizing anything, there are several things that you should consider doing. Of course, you cannot start organizing before cleaning and disinfecting your appliance. The importance of doing this is that it prevents any form of contamination or the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Follow the proceeding steps to deep-clean your fridge before anything else.</p>



<p><strong> Empty the Fridge</strong></p>



<p> You want to clean all the surfaces on your fridge, therefore, the first thing you should do is to empty it. Maybe you have certain foods that you will be concerned about getting spoiled. If this is the case, the best way to clean will be by moving from one section to the other. You could also place perishable food in a cooler as you perform the cleaning.</p>



<p> <strong>Clean all Surfaces</strong></p>



<p> After emptying the fridge, the next thing will be to clean all the surfaces using paper towels or a disinfecting wipe. All the shelves, including the door compartments, should be thoroughly cleaned. As for the drawers, you should remove them from the fridge and allow them to soak for some time before rinsing them.</p>



<p><strong> Reassemble the Fridge</strong></p>



<p> When you are sure that the fridge is completely clean and dry, reassemble everything in place. If you often have an issue with your food causing odors, you should use a deodorizer such as baking soda.</p>



<h3> Developing a Plan</h3>



<p> The process of organizing your fridge begins with a practical plan of how you will do it. It is essential that you use a realistic plan to guide you through the process from one section to the other. The advantage of working with a plan is that you will know where to start and where to end. Moreover, it will help you identify areas you should concentrate on.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Upper Shelf</h3>



<p> Starting with the upper shelves, you should know what to store and how to store them. For instance, the ideal items to store in this section include drinks, deli meats, cheese and food leftovers. Veggies and raw meat should not be stored in this section.</p>



<p> <strong>Proper Labeling</strong></p>



<p> When storing food in the upper shelf, you should also bear in mind that they are perishable. Make sure you label them appropriately. If there are foods that will expire soon, they should be at the front area of the upper shelf. Others that will last longer should be positioned at the back.</p>



<p> <strong>Utilize the Lazy Susan Storage Hack</strong></p>



<p> Regardless of the presence of a wire rack inside your fridge, it doesn’t mean that you cannot organize your fridge using other creative hacks. One of the main challenges you might experience with the wire racks is that it will be difficult to locate certain foods inside your fridge. This happens most often when it is fully packed. You find people remove everything from the fridge so they can access what they need at the back.</p>



<p> Do you know that you can deal with this by utilizing the lazy Susan storage hack. This involves the idea of using a sizable round tray to hold the contents of your fridge. Arranging them in this tray and putting it in the fridge will help you easily access your items. All you will need to do is rotate the tray.<br> There is no need for you to risk spilling condiments while trying to get things at the back of your fridge. Be creative.</p>



<p><strong> Use Hanging Baskets</strong></p>



<p><br> Baskets are handy all around your kitchen, including inside the fridge. There are specially designed baskets that use suction cups to stick to your fridge.<br> These baskets provide a great way of storing small items. These items can easily get lost or they fall from one section to the other. Avoid this by fitting your fridge with these baskets. You might be wondering what you can store in them. Gorguts, cheese roll-ups, waffles or string cheese can be effectively stored in this space.</p>



<p> <strong>Use Wire Shelf Rack</strong></p>



<p> Wire shelf racks can either be used in the lower or upper fridge compartments to create additional space. One section of the rack can hold leftover food and the other section can hold boxed juices. Instead of piling the entire shelf with food containers, you should consider using wire shelf racks. These racks give your fridge a more spacious and beautiful look.</p>



<p> Take note of the fact that the hacks provided in either upper or lower shelves apply to any section inside your fridge. Therefore, you are not limited to using hanging baskets in the upper section only.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Lower Shelf</h3>



<p> After finishing working on the upper shelf, you can proceed to the lower compartment. Since the upper part houses foods that are ready to eat, this area should store raw foods and ingredients. Creative storage ideas that you can incorporate here are as detailed.</p>



<p> <strong>Assemble Like Items Together</strong></p>



<p> Similar items should be grouped together. While doing this, it is essential that you make use of clear baskets. This makes it easy for you to identify what’s inside them. A larger tray can be used to assemble like items together. For instance, different types of veggies can be grouped together in a tray. Don’t forget to first store the veggies independently before bringing them together.<br> This applies to any raw foods that you will want to store here.</p>



<p> <strong>Take Advantage of File Organizers</strong></p>



<p> If you have worked in an office, then you must be aware of what we are talking about. File organizers can be used in the fridge as they create space for storing snacks. Whether you want to store small containers or pouch drinks, these file organizers are handy. To make things more organized, you should consider labeling the sections. Certainly, you should have a clear picture of how this idea will give your fridge a well-structured look.</p>



<p> <strong>Hang Bagged Items</strong></p>



<p> If your fridge has a wire bar, it is highly likely that you might not have used it. These bars can be used to create additional storage space. How? Use curtain rings to hang on these bars. This can then be used to store bagged items in your fridge. Ensure that you use the right hanging clips that will not damage the storage bags.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Crisper Drawer</h3>



<p> The last section of your fridge will be the crisper drawer. We all know those people who store fruits here by just washing and throwing them in. After all, there is nothing that you can do to make the section more organized, right? Well, you&#8217;re wrong.</p>



<p> <strong>Utilize Dividers</strong></p>



<p> Instead of just tossing your fruit and other ingredients in this drawer, you should make use of dividers. These dividers will help you create separate spaces for the varying items you have inside your drawer. For instance, with the help of two or more dividers, oranges, apples and tomatoes can be stored separately.</p>



<p><strong> Use Paper Towels at the Bottom</strong></p>



<p> A huge problem with the bottom drawer is that it is often filled with litter every time we load them with veggies and fruit. Also, the moisture present in the fruit can leave the drawer with a foul smell. To deal with this issue, it is advisable to use a paper towel. Take note of the fact that this should be done prior to loading your drawer. Again, it is imperative that you replace the paper towels at least twice a month. The same can be done each time you feel that the towels need changing. Cleaning the fruit and veggies and drying them thoroughly will aid in odor and spoilage prevention.</p>



<p><strong> Effectively Control the Humidity</strong></p>



<p> We cannot forget that the lower drawer will have humidity controls.<br> However, this will depend on the type of fridge that you own. Modern fridges have these controls to help your veggies and fruits last longer. You have the option of setting the humidity as either low or high.</p>



<p> Before doing this, make sure you understand that setting the humidity dial on high will affect raw foods that can easily rot. Therefore, veggies and fruits should be stored in low humidity. If you have two drawers with different controls, high humidity will suit leafy greens such as herbs, arugula and spinach. The veggies will be fresh for longer due to the high moisture present.</p>



<h3> Organizing the Door</h3>



<p> Compared to other parts of the fridge, this is the warmest area. As such, condiments are best stored in this area. Most people use this area to store milk and eggs. However, you should note that these are perishable items.<br> Hence, they should be stored in the coldest section of the fridge. Items that should be stored here include butter, sauces, and condiments. How do you go about this?</p>



<p> <strong>Store Like Items Together</strong></p>



<p> Any form of organization that goes on in your kitchen should always embrace this principle. When organizing your refrigerator door, you should put like items together. Proper labeling will also be required to make sure you eat foods that are close to expiration. Equally, this labeling also ensures that you keep your fridge neat. It also helps other users in your house to understand where they should store what they just used. Generally, it provides a convenient way of accessing your fridge.</p>



<p> <strong>Egg Carton for Storage</strong></p>



<p> The egg carton that you usually use to hold your eggs can also be used to hold condiments in bottles. Storing them upside-down creates more space in the small door shelves.</p>



<p><strong> Children Drinks go at the Bottom</strong></p>



<p> The last shelf should be designated to hold drinks for your children. For those who don’t have children, the section can be a great place to store snacks. In line with this, you should ensure that you teach your children about where their drinks are located. This will prevent them from looking in other sections as this will only mess things up in the fridge.</p>



<p> <strong>Six-Pack Beer Boxes</strong></p>



<p> The six-pack beer boxes can also be handy for storing things in the fridge door. Smaller condiments can be stored in these boxes. So, you don’t have to throw these boxes if you were looking for a creative way of creating space in your fridge door.</p>



<p> The information detailed in this section provides you with an effective way of ensuring your fridge is organized. At times the process might seem challenging because of the many small things that you have to store in the appliance. However, from what has been discussed, it is the best way of storing your items wisely. What’s more, there is a lot that you stand to benefit, including the fact that you will prevent yourself from wasting food.<br> You cannot ignore the fact that an organized fridge will motivate you to snack on a healthy dish.</p>

<h1>Forgive</h1>



<p> Life is a series of moments.<br> Moments make seconds. Seconds make minutes. Minutes make hours. Hours make days. Days make weeks. Weeks make months. Months make years. Years make a lifetime of living.</p>



<p> And in reality, that is how we live – moment to moment.</p>



<p> Every emotion we experience happens in the present. Even if we are giggling about a memory or fretting about the future, we don’t experience either outside of right when we are thinking in the present moment. We are living right now with our feelings – good or bad, happy or sad. And we take them with us from one moment to the next.</p>



<p> But it all starts with the moment we are living right now – this second.</p>



<p> Not convinced? Stop breathing and see if the memory of breathing yesterday comforts you. No one suffocating cares about how they might breathe tomorrow. All they want is to breathe now – at the moment they are experiencing.</p>



<p> Thankfully most of us don’t have to suffocate to get focused on the moment.</p>



<p> The question is, now that you know how important this moment is as a building block of your life, how are you living it? Are you dragging anger and resentment from this one to the next? Are you unwilling to forgive even the simplest slight or harshest transgression at this moment?</p>



<p> Remember moments make seconds that turn quickly into a lifetime of living. Use this moment wisely. Forgive someone. Even if you can only manage to forgive for a second, do it. Keep at it and you will find you have built a lifetime of living in forgiveness. And that’s a good thing.</p>



<h1>Be Hopeful</h1>



<p> Become a prisoner of hope.</p>



<p> Don’t weigh the odds and then make a decision to be optimistic. Don’t try to calculate all the variables. Don’t try to envision every possible outcome.</p>



<p> The universe is too big. The variables are too fluid. There’s no way to wrap the mind around all the possible outcomes in an infinite universe.</p>



<p> Pride comes before the fall. Recognize pride’s arrogance in choosing to be optimistic based on running the numbers. Avoid the fall.</p>



<p> Avoid the fall by not becoming a prisoner of a formula concocted to navigate life. Weighing the odds as a path to optimism fails. Pessimism is always there, lurking in the background. Whatever positive outcome may be yielded from running the numbers draws its inverse as well. Fear stalks success from the shadows of doubt.</p>



<p> Cast aside the shadows. Stand firm in the light inside the cheerful walls of hope. With hope, there are no calculations, no variables to weigh and no negatives to compare.</p>



<p> Hope defies the odds. Faith sees through circumstances. Together, they achieve the impossible and take us where logic will fail us.</p>



<p> Ironically, when we are faced with the darkest times, we often become a prisoner of hope and chain ourselves to faith by default. They are our last resorts when everything else fails us. We surrender and in doing so, achieve what we thought was impossible.</p>



<p> Stop doing the math. Erase the formula. Become a prisoner of hope now, in this moment.</p>



<p> Use this affirmation, “I believe in good. I see the good. I experience good. I know all good is happening for me now.”</p>



<h1> Communicate Effectively</h1>



<p> Have you ever come across a situation where someone is on the losing end just because of his/her lack of effective communication? Well, I have plenty of experiences to elaborate on this phenomenon. Have any of following instances happened with you?</p>



<p> You thought your boss would love your idea, but she did not give it serious consideration because you were not able to make her understand exactly what you meant. You thought your spouse wanted you to praise him/her and indeed you wanted to, but you failed to convey the praise. You did not get a job, although you were the most eligible candidate, because you could not successfully convince the hiring manager to understand your qualifications.</p>



<p> Every once in a while, I used to find myself in one of these types of situations. I then decided to strategize and determine if I could improve my position in these situations by enhancing my communication skills, and trust me, I thank God for that day when He made me move in this direction. We can all continuously improve our communication techniques. Even though you think you are perfect at communicating, you will soon realize that much room for improvement exists once you start working on it. Several rules to the game of communication are key components that you need to keep in mind if you want the receiver of your communications to not just hear you, but listen to you:</p>



<ol><li>The receiver is the king of the game, regardless of who you are and who the receiver is, hopefully the receiver is also a listener, because any kind of communication is effective only if it is two-way i.e., the person with whom you want to communicate is actually listening. So, forget that you are the boss, forget that you are the elder, forget everything and mold yourself to suit the receiver of the communication.</li><li>Do not be too specific or too detailed while communicating (except for SMS, which should be short enough).</li><li>Keep it simple. Do not complicate your language. Complicated language will not do any good except for impressing or tiring the listener and making them think that he/she need not listen as he/she will not understand it anyway. It&#8217;s okay to use jargon sometimes, but do not make it a habit or overuse such terms, at least not in very important communications.</li><li>Clarity of thoughts is an extremely important tool for effective communication as you can only convey something that you understand yourself. Understanding something yourself does not ensure that you will communicate it well, however, so be careful to break it down into manageable nuggets of information.</li><li>Be confident of your position. First, you need to believe something completely, to make others believe it.</li><li>Watch your wording. Sometimes, you may tend to use words that you do not really want to use, and in fact you do not even know how they will impact the listener. Be careful and keep watch over your own vocabulary, and avoid talking without thinking at all. Use a filter before speaking. Some filters may be: Is this true? Is this relevant? Is this hurtful? Is this biased? Do I want someone to repeat this and quote me? Try to be politically correct at least in public places, if not with family.</li></ol>



<p> I hope you seriously consider adopting these techniques. Enjoy your day. </p>



<h1>Calm Your Mind</h1>



<p> Calm your mind at this moment. It’s really not that big of a challenge.<br> Nothing is that challenging because nothing is permanent. Nothing lasts forever. Not one physical item. Your car, house, the street on which you live, and the city in which you live can fall away without a moment’s notice.<br> Nothing is permanent. Every tree, every bird, every rock, every drop of water evaporates into the nothingness from whence it came. Even your body will return to its origins and break down into the very molecules and atoms that make the universe.</p>



<p> Ashes to ashes and dust to dust are not an end, but another step on a journey everything and everyone will take.<br> That’s the challenge. We temporarily mitigate the challenge by preserving museum artifacts and by keeping bodies functioning longer with medical advances. We write our thoughts on paper, in books, on computer chips, and in the vast cloud of technology. Eventually, they will all go the way of dust.</p>



<p> The only big challenge about anything is the importance we give it in our own minds. The universe doesn’t care. Even stars eventually grow cold and wink out of existence. What chance does your favorite chair have against that? No chance at all.</p>



<p> This is not to say we shouldn’t try. We should try because life is worth living.<br> It’s just that when we can accept the impermanence of everything in the universe, we gain perspective.<br> Perspective saves us from the disaster of thinking and acting as if what we’re doing, or wanting or holding onto are the most important things in the universe. Stars eventually grow cold and wink out of existence. What chance does your coveted item, your brilliant scheme, your careful planning have against that? No chance at all.</p>



<p> Keep everything in perspective. Mt. Everest is but a speck from space. A diamond is still a rock. One man’s treasure is another man’s trash. There’s always a bigger fish to catch.<br> Calm your mind at this moment. It’s not that big of a challenge.<br> Free yourself from fear with perspective. Appreciate and give thanks for the people and things you have now – today.<br> Take deep, relaxing breaths with this affirmation, “I live in the moment with everything and everyone. I accept all my good and give thanks for what is now.”</p>



<h1>Reduce Sugar Intake</h1>



<p> You are getting so close; congratulations! Take a moment and celebrate your success today! You have come extremely far and are right on the cusp of completing this program and jump-starting your new and improved life. Let’s finish strong!</p>



<p> Today, we are going to replace one sugary drink with a tall, cool glass of water. Our bodies are made up primarily of water and we need to continuously pump more and more in to replace what we lose in sweat. Your body needs optimal amounts of water to function at max capacity and keep you running strong and smooth all day long. Try and find an area where you can make this essential swap that will offer multiple benefits to your health and to your life.</p>



<p> Do you drink sugary sodas, flavored coffees, iced mochas, even diet sodas loaded with artificial sugars? If so, these are what we are looking to replace.<br> Don’t worry, I am not asking you to go cold turkey and give them up all together. Start by replacing just one and work your way up from there.</p>



<p> By making the switch to water you will feel full, causing you to eat less. You will feel more hydrated which has benefits for your mental alertness and skin tone. You will be sheltered from the typical crash that comes along with a burst of sugar, helping you to be more productive throughout the day. Plus, you will save the calories, helping you to lose weight and look and feel better. Now, who doesn’t want that?</p>



<h1>Relax and Let Good Things Happen</h1>



<p> Be encouraged. There are seven billion people in the world. All of them are moving through life just like you. They stumble. They fall. They get up and keep moving.</p>



<p> They move through the bad and get to the good. They move through the good and get to the bad. Then they move through the worst, and eventually get to the good stuff again.<br> And so it goes, on and on…<br> Like mice constantly searching for cheese, people live life running back and forth between good and bad, ultimately hunting for something better. They are anxious and fearful even in good times because the next bad thing is right around the corner. When the bad times come they are anxious and fearful because, well…things are bad. How else are you supposed to feel?</p>



<p> Good to bad, bad to good, good to bad, bad to good, and back again. The whole thing is crazily exhausting. Honestly running back and forth between the two extremes should drive a person insane – because it is crazy to run in circles all the time.</p>



<p> That’s the world – crazy. And the world expects you to be crazy right along with it. Stop running around like a crazy person!<br> Be encouraged. Good things are happening. Relax and let them happen to you. Notice the good in you and your life. Even when things seem bad, even when things are legitimately bad, good is still there – right where you are at the moment.</p>



<p> Pay attention to the good. Give thanks for the good. If all you have is one slice of bread, eat it with a grateful heart. If you have two slices of bread with your favorite meat, lettuce and tomatoes, but no mayo, eat the sandwich and be grateful. You don’t have to starve to learn how to take what you have and be grateful because it beats being hungry.</p>



<p> This is not a lesson about settling for less. Far from it, this is a lesson about getting more. Recognize what is truly good by being grateful for what sustains you and keeps you alive. The rest is extra stuff that’s nice to have, but won’t kill you if you don’t. Rise above crazy and know goodness.<br> Congratulations on all of your progress throughout this journey and I hope you continue moving forward in a positive direction. See you tomorrow for the final day of our 21-day challenge.</p>



<h1> Review Your Previous Habits and Set New Goals</h1>



<p> Give yourself a massive pat on the back for making it through this 21 Day exercise! All of these changes were small in nature, but I am hoping that you truly saw massive gains in your life. And, I hope it does not stop here. I hope you continue to put into practice the techniques we went through together to ensure exponential growth in your personal and professional lives. On our final day together, I want you to review and work on new goals.</p>



<p> Do you remember those goals you wrote out in Chapter 1 on the very first day of reading this book? I want you to dig those out and re-read them now.<br> Really spend some time walking through them and thinking about them.<br> Now, spend a few minutes answering the following questions about those goals:</p>



<p> Did you achieve any of the goals you set on day 1?<br> Were there any goals that you did not achieve, but you came really close to achieving?<br> How have your goals changed since you started this book?<br> ❖ Are your goals more singular, more focused or broader?<br> ❖ Have your priorities and goals shifted in any way?<br> ❖ Did some goals seem daunting in the beginning, but now seem too easy?</p>



<p> After this review, I am sure some of you have already started working on new goals; or, at least making adjustments to your existing goals. Get creative with them, and have a little fun letting your imagination wander. </p>



<p><strong>Best of luck and keep driving forward!</strong></p>

<h2>1) Create a Budget that will Work for You</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1.jpg" alt="wallet" class="wp-image-853" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wallet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> This is where so many people become confused and give up when they are trying to live on less, but it does not have to be difficult. You need to learn how to create a realistic budget and how to stick to it.</p>



<p> Budgets are easy, but sometimes when you have more going out than what is coming in, stress follows. For now, don’t worry about balancing your budget, just worry about all of your main bills and your income.</p>



<p> Start by adding up all of the money you have coming into your home. If you have money coming in that is not guaranteed, such as child support, do not count this as your income. Only count what you know you will get no matter what. This is the amount on which you are going to base all of your spendings. The money that is not guaranteed can be considered a bonus, and we will discuss it later.</p>



<p> Next, add up all of the essential bills you have to pay. This means your electric, your phone, your internet, your cable, house payment and so forth.<br> Do not count discretionary items, such as going out to eat, purchasing clothing and entertainment. Only list the living expenses that you have to pay.</p>



<p> Grab a notebook and use it specifically for budgeting your money. At the top of the page, you are going to write your income. Then create a column of bills and debts you need to pay such as house payment and electricity. Next to the bills, write down the amount that is paid. For bills such as your electricity, use an average payment. For example, my electric is higher in the winter but very low in the summer, by using an average I am able to leave some money in the bank in the summer to use for electric in the winter. (Tip: Many utility companies allow you to pay the average monthly.)</p>



<p> Add up the total of all of your bills and see how it compares to the amount of money you have coming in. If you don’t have enough money coming in to cover what is going out, you will have to make some changes.</p>



<p> Finally, at the bottom of the page, you need to list additional items for which you typically need money, such as birthdays, school supplies, or clothing.<br> These are items that may not come up every month but still need to be periodically covered.</p>



<p> Once you have this completed, you are ready to start looking at what can be cut from your budget so that you are able to live on less. But what are the benefits of being able to live on less? (Maybe the cable is not as important as you thought, especially if you are constantly stressing over not having enough money every month.)</p>



<p> I once saw a Facebook post that said, “We spend our entire life focusing on earning a living so that we can have a happy life, then we find out that we are so busy earning a living that we have no life to enjoy.” Learning to live on less will ensure that you have time to actually enjoy life and not waste it working all the time.</p>



<h2>2) Take a Walk</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1.jpg" alt="walking" class="wp-image-854" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/walking-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Many health experts recommend at least 10,000 steps per day for a healthy lifestyle. I’m here to tell you that unless you are a server at a busy restaurant or a professional runner, getting 10,000 steps per day is HARD. I struggle to get them in on a daily basis, but when I do, I notice a difference in how I feel and in my energy levels. For me, walking has so many benefits that improve not only my physical health, but also my mental health.</p>



<p> First and foremost, walking gets the blood flowing. Taking a walk is exercise and it is essential for good cardiovascular health. Walking gives me a few minutes to escape and let my mind wander to things of interest to me and not just work or what my family should have for dinner that night. Sometimes, I just walk to clear my head, and getting moving allows me the opportunity to step away from it all, even if for only 15 minutes. In addition, I recommend trying to take your walk outside, if at all possible to breathe in the fresh air and soak up some vitamin D.</p>



<p> I know some of you are thinking that you would love to take walks, but you just don’t have the time. Maybe you have meetings and conference calls all day and just don’t have an extra 15-20 minutes to step away. Trust me I have days like these as well. In this situation, I like to schedule it so that I can take at least one of my calls on the move. I put on my earbuds with the built-in microphone and listen or talk while I walk. I’ve actually found that some of my best calls have come while I’m out on a walk, as exercise and physical activity have been proven to improve brain function. So, if you don’t take a walk for yourself, take it for your company; they’ll be glad you did. Get out there and get to stepping!</p>



<h2>3) Organize Your house</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg" alt="house cleaning" class="wp-image-855" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Hang a corkboard in your mudroom or foyer to help keep you organized as you dash out of the house. The board is perfect for those shopping lists, prescriptions, or reminder notes that you seem always to be forgetting. Give it some extra functionality by screwing a magnetic knife holder to the frame of your cork board. Use it to hold keys (not good for car keys with built-in chips), scissors, a screwdriver, and even a small flashlight.</p>



<p> Hang a large tote bag in a common area and use it to collect clothing and other items destined for donation.</p>



<p> Buy some clear plastic business card sheets to organize all those cards lying about. These sheets are also handy for organizing sewing kits, embroidery thread or even coupons. The larger divider sheets are perfect for storing recipes.</p>



<p> Between cell phones, MP3 players, PDA&#8217;s, you name it, we have more devices charging than we have counter space. Organize your electronic chargers in one box with a hole in the bottom to insert a power bar cord.<br> Attach the power bar to the bottom of the box and plug in all your electronic toys. Keep the lid open when in use to prevent heat build up.</p>



<p> Clothespins aren&#8217;t just for hanging wet clothes. They make great closet organizers for hats, mitts and scarves. Glue the pins to the inside of closet doors and keep your mitts organized in the cold weather. Use the same idea in an office cupboard to hang memos, cards, photos or small calendars.</p>



<p> Use pretty glass knobs or other coordinating hardware to hang towels over the sink in the laundry room.</p>



<p> Sometimes candles will sit in a drawer for an entire year without being used, and they may easily be broken during that time. Next time you empty a roll of paper towels, use your empty cardboard roll to store candles, labeling each tube with the color and size of the candle.</p>



<p> The next time you have to go poking around a dark place like your crawl space or fuse box, have a flashlight ready to go. If your flashlight is metal, simply attach a small magnet to the outside of the fuse box, or glue a strip of Velcro for plastic versions. Do not forget to put batteries in the flashlight.</p>



<p> If you purchase large bags of dog food, simply empty into a small garbage pail for easy storage. Close the lid tightly and the food will stay fresh for weeks.</p>



<p> Organize the cupboard under the sink by hanging small items like scrubbers, rubber gloves and dust rags on clothespins or hooks found to the door’s inside.</p>



<p> These are just some ideas, but the idea is to look around, embrace the clutter you see and do something about it!</p>



<h2>4) Pause and Give Thanks</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1.jpg" alt="thankful" class="wp-image-856" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/give-thanks-1-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Texts, emails and social media got us running. Bills, work and hustling for money got us running. Five minutes into the day and we are humming.<br> Life is a whirlwind moving along at the speed of light.<br> We got dreams. We got plans. We’re building a better life.<br> That’s good but we don’t live in dreams. We can’t experience the joy of life in plans. We can’t build a better life without appreciating the life we’re living now.<br> Pause for a moment and take a look at your surroundings. Stay at the moment.<br> Look at life.<br> Look for the good. Look for what’s going right. See the blessings. Take it all in and give thanks.</p>



<p> Yes, things may not be as excellent as you would like. Give thanks for the good you see. Yes, many things may not be going exactly as you would like.<br> Give thanks for what is turning in your favor. And yes, it’s hard to bless the mess you may be experiencing. Do it anyway.</p>



<p> Reclaim your power. Show the world that society cannot bind you, technology cannot grind you, and fear cannot find you. Be the boss of you. Step out of the world. Step into faith.<br> Focus your heart and mind on good and declare for yourself that everything – everything – is all right. Nothing has power over you.</p>



<p> Free yourself now, at this moment with this affirmation, “Everything is all right with me and my world. Only good happens to me. Everything is all right with me and my world. Only good happens to me. Everything is all right with me and my world.</p>



<h2>5) Ask for Help</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1.jpg" alt="ask for help" class="wp-image-857" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ask-for-help-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> If you are anything like me, then you have a problem admitting that you can’t do it all. I really struggle with not having the answers or not being able to handle everything in my life, on my own. I’m the one who helps others, not the other way around. Well, I’m here to tell you two things:</p>



<ol><li>No one can do everything on their own and no one is an expert in all things.</li><li>It’s ok to seek help, guidance or advice from someone who is better than you at a task or an area of life.</li></ol>



<p>Take an opportunity today to think of an area where you are not as strong as you would like to be. This could be any skill, including time management, money management, sales, writing, spreadsheets or something simple like doing a cart wheel. Find someone who is successful in an area where you could stand to improve and find out what they did to achieve this level of success. Tell them what you admire about them and seek their guidance. You would be surprised how many folks are willing to share their knowledge, especially when you stroke their ego a little.</p>



<p> If I could leave you with one key piece of advice from today’s lesson it could be summed up in two words. Be vulnerable. It’s ok to put yourself out there and admit you have weaknesses; because we all do. Weaknesses do not make you weak, but not admitting them will. Putting yourself out there and being vulnerable can be a key driver to success. It makes us uncomfortable, and stretches our boundaries, and ultimately teaches us something new.<br> Having trouble getting the conversation started? Try these icebreakers…<br> • “Would you mind helping me with…?”<br> • “I’ve noticed you are amazing at . Do you have 30 minutes to show me a few tricks?” </p>



<p> These are easy, to the point and difficult to say “no” to. Try it; the results will be phenomenal!</p>



<h2>6) Fill Your Heart with Love and Conquer Fear</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1.jpg" alt="heart love" class="wp-image-858" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-heart-love-1-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> Fear is the root of all anger, discord and conflict. Trace any negative action to its source and you will find fear.</p>



<p> Fear turns discussions into arguments, dislike into hatred and anger into murder. It can poison relationships and sabotage success. Unchecked fear will kill everything it touches – even you.</p>



<p> The first lesson a person learns when swimming is not to be afraid of the water. Fear causes panic. People who panic drown. The way to stop panicking and drowning is to calm down and float. The same is true when facing life’s challenges.</p>



<p> When the arguing starts and you get a tightening in your belly, ask yourself what is it that we are talking about that makes me so afraid that now I am getting angry?</p>



<p> When the insult causes you to flinch and the anger swells, stop and reflect on the source. When the little pebble of dislike drops, before you say, “I don’t like so-and-so,” trace the reason to the root and you will find fear. You will also find fear at the root of a scary decision. Fear leads you to jump to conclusions and embrace bad decisions based on a boogey man shouting “what-ifs” at you.</p>



<p> Remember, fear causes panic. People who panic drown. Don’t drown in the situation. Calm down and float. Shift your attention to love.</p>



<p> You may not feel the love in the heat of the moment. But if you are thinking love, you are not thinking about smacking someone upside their head. Even if all you can manage is to spell the word “L-O-V-E” in your mind, your brain is too busy to try to come up with the clever retort or insult in response. You are thinking love. You are calming down and floating.</p>



<p> You may not think love is the solution to a serious problem you are trying to solve or dilemma you are trying to unravel. Love will stop you from drowning in a pool of doubt as you flail about looking for an answer. Even if all you can manage at first is spelling the word love in your mind when you think of the challenge, this simple act will allow you to calm down and float.</p>



<p> Eventually, you will make a better decision because you will be acting out of love instead of acting out of fear. Love conquers fear. Put love in your heart now. When you draw on this love in a moment of battling fear, draw upon it as your armor against fear; the love you put there now will still be there, use it.</p>



<p> Here’s a love centering affirmation, “This situation has no power over me. I am love. Love is me. I find the right and perfect solution in the right and perfect way to every challenge.”</p>



<h2>7) Replace One Unhealthy Snack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1.jpg" alt="Unhealthy Snack" class="wp-image-859" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chips-snack-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> For today’s task, I want you to take one unhealthy snack and replace it with something nutritious. Perhaps, instead of potato chips, you make the move to carrots and hummus. Or, instead of a candy bar, you reach for an apple. You will be surprised how filling an apple can be. Not to mention, it is full of nutrients and is surprisingly sweet.</p>



<p> Trust me, I have been there. It is incredibly convenient AND delicious to grab that unhealthy snack and bypass the stuff that actually has nutritional value. But, if you can make that switch, you will end up taking in fewer calories while adding additional nutrients. These small but significantly better choices will lead to a healthier lifestyle, a better fitting wardrobe, and a better looking, more productive you. Go out there and eat well and look and feel great! Remember, one good choice leads to another.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1769" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lots of us believe that we eat our feelings and <em>need to get some control goddammit</em>. But what is actually even more common, and way more detrimental, is using <em>dieting and control</em> to numb our feelings.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dieting is one of the big ways we try to avoid feeling our bodies. It is a perfect storm of distraction, control, perfectionism, and the chemical high we get from adrenaline and other stress hormones when we restrict our food.Dieting is a way to disconnect us from our bodies and stifle our life force. <em>Less</em> food and <em>higher</em> stress hormones help us temporarily live with less feeling, not to mention all of the concentration and focus it takes to override your appetite and famine response. Dieting is a distraction.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">All of the following tools and exercises are devoted to help you begin feeling. You are going to be doing enough work on habitually feeling emotions, and when you do that, emotional eating will lose its power. When you are committed to feeling emotions, the coping mechanisms you’ve used naturally begin to take a healthier role in your life.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We become dysfunctional with food, and it’s not usually because of emotional eating at all. It’s because of restriction, guilt, and the biological survival cycle that it induces—and also because of our deep fear of weight and taking up space. As long as you are getting out of reactive famine mode, <em>and</em> learning to feel instead of numb, you don’t need to worry about emotional eating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do not get stuck in the trap of worrying that you need to stop emotionally eating—that will become restriction. Just eat and feel. I also want to remind you that eating is never a problem in and of itself. Shift your attention instead to making sure you aren’t trying to numb or distract yourself with control, perfectionism, and <em>dieting</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s also important to note that emotional eating and bingeing aren’t the same thing. In all of my experience working with so many, manyyyy people who believed that emotional eating was their problem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. once they stopped restricting, they were able to see that emotional eating was not actually their <em>core</em> problem at all. Emotional eating is not the reason most people are so dysfunctional with food. The problem is the biological famine response and the yo-yo of restriction, which leads to bingeing. That is the thing to fix if you want to become normal with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even if you worry that you tend to eat to numb, the answer is still never to restrict, because that will just start up the yo-yo again. In the physical part of the process (and always) the answer is eating. The answer now is also feeling.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The truth is, eating emotionally is actually perfectly healthy and normal. All humans eat emotionally. Your cravings and your body’s needs are directly affected by your mental state and your stress levels. You are <em>meant</em> to have the option to comfort yourself with food. You are not a robot eating battery pellets for energy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Food is fuel and nutrition, but it is also allowed to be comforting and grounding. And eating food to comfort and fill you up or to connect with others is a <em>nonissue</em> when you’re not in a reactive binge/repent cycle. When you are actually feeding yourself and trusting your body, <em>and</em> your body actually trusts that it is being fed, comfort eating can just be a part of a very normal relationship with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, eating birthday cake is an emotional reason to eat food: celebration. And eating a big bowl of macaroni and cheese when you are tired and sad is a legitimate way to comfort and feed yourself.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating will happen. It is part of being human. It is part of being a normal eater. It is part of assessing what we need in any given moment and trying to comfort ourselves. That will always be okay. The more neutral food becomes, the more your body will naturally, without thinking about it, balance and account for times when we eat emotionally or “more than we need.” That’s what a healthy balanced body and appetite does. You don’t need to do <em>anything</em> about it. Just eat. Just listen. Just trust that this eating thing <em>ain’t that deep</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating <em>is not bingeing</em>. The problem only comes when you feel guilty about emotional eating. <em>That</em> triggers the guilt-and-repent cycle: Feeling guilty for eating. Deciding to restrict a little to make up for it. Then all hell breaks loose. Then you’re back in the yo-yo. The bottom line is, don’t feel guilty about eating, because that will only perpetuate your dysfunction with food.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve pulled together a list here of the basic commonsense eating guidelines I live by. Instead of being motivated by the fear of negative consequences, why not try to implement one or more of these in your life?</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong> Eat mostly plants<br>Despite the vast differences in doctrine between the mainstream and alternative nutrition experts, the one thing we can all agree on is that eating plant foods is really good. I like to ensure that plant foods – such as nuts, seeds, fruits, grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa, buckwheat), fruits, sea vegetables, herbs and spices – make up the majority of my diet, with the greatest emphasis on seasonal vegetables and especially greens. I still enjoy animal products such as meat, eggs, fish, cheese, butter and ghee, but in smaller quantities.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2</strong> Avoid processed foods where you can<br>Industrially produced foods that your ancestors wouldn’t comprehend are best eaten in small amounts. Any ingredient with a number, or a name that doesn’t register as ‘food’ when you read it, probably isn’t food. Stick to things that are foods, in as natural a state as possible. If a laboratory or factory has done most of the preparation, it’s probably better to leave it on the supermarket shelf.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>3</strong> Live by the 80:20 rule<br>Sticking to your nutritional values 80 per cent of the time will allow you a healthy margin where you can say yes to the chocolate cake at your friends’ birthday parties, or enjoy a big slab of pizza as you travel through Naples. There are food opportunities in life that just can’t be ignored or turned down. Don’t be that killjoy. Allowing yourself the space to stray from your regular nourishing eating habits will help you not to take yourself too seriously, and will bring freedom to your social food situations. Twenty per cent indulgence won’t do you any harm if you’re otherwise healthy.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>4</strong> Balance out your eating<br>Eating is all about balance. If you’ve been out of your normal routine while at work or on holidays and found you’ve overindulged in a specific food, spend the next few days nourishing yourself back to homoeostasis (metabolic balance) with the foods you’ve been missing. If you’ve spent a few days eating lots of starchy, cooked foods, for example, it might be a good idea to spend a couple of days eating some raw and lighter foods through vegie juices, salads and vegetable soups.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>5</strong> Take an Ayurvedic approach<br>Traditional  Ayurvedic medicine teaches us that we attain health when we eat a practical balance of different types of foods from the taste categories of bitter, sweet, sour, salty, astringent and pungent.Having a varied diet of different tastes,eating seasonally, and ensuring the right balance of cooked and cold foods helps the nervous system recognise nourishment. You can work out your ideal Ayurvedic eating plan by determining your dosha, which will help you eat in a commonsense way for your unique body type.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>6</strong> Choose quality over quantity<br>This is especially true with animal products. Overall, try to invest in better-quality food that’s chemical-free or organic. Shop at local farmers’ markets rather than supermarkets if possible. With animal products, look for organic or 100 per cent grass-fed and grass-finished. It’s better to enjoy smaller amounts of quality food than gorging on food that’s cheap and of lower quality.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Unplug, turn off the TV, sit at the table, use proper dinnerware, eat with friends and family, and give thanks. Tune in to all your senses and pay attention to enjoying and savouring each glorious mouthful. Enjoy the following morning and afternoon tea delights.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
