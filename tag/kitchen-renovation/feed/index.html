<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In a supercharged kitchen, true nourishment begins. There’s so much potential, wherever you live, to create memories of love and hospitality that will linger in the imagination of your family and friends. The kitchen is where your food culture is established, where you decide on and store the kinds of ingredients you wish to share with your loved ones. You can either have a pantry full of pre-packaged foods, or a wondrous landscape of individual, fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients waiting to be combined into fulfilling, wholesome meals.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Many people find the kitchen a stressful place to be; some even despise cooking, preferring to fork out money for a convenient takeaway meal. The problem with this is you’re not just paying for the food, you’re paying for a business. The way many restaurant and take away businesses make their money is by minimizing expenditure to increase their profit margin; in other words, they buy cheap, low-quality ingredients, make them taste good by coating them in additive-laden sauces and seasonings, then sell each dish at a price that allows their staff, rent and bills to be paid, with some extra on top for the business owners. I’d much rather put my money towards quality, ethically produced ingredients sourced from local producers and farmers’ markets, add a little kitchen work and enjoy a meal that’s better on my wallet, better for the planet, and better for my body and my family. You? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Food is at the heart of the home, and cooking is the vehicle to ensure a healthier and happier society. Michael Pollan famously addresses what he calls ‘a curious paradox’ around food in his book Cooked, where he observes that his fellow Americans seem to be devoting more time to thinking about food than ever before. An increasing interest in TV shows about food and cooking coincides with a collective disengagement from real food and the act of cooking in the home. With more meals prepared outside the home thanks to industrial food production, it seems the less Americans cook, the more interesting they find food and its preparation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> If we’re so transfixed by cooking that we spend hours gazing at, thinking about and observing it in the media, why as a society do we value our own kitchens so little? It’s time we began to fall in love with the instinctive, natural, utterly human behaviour of cooking once again, and we can only fall in love with our kitchens when we rekindle our love for food. Food is central to the seven keystones of life, as discussed earlier, and this is where we need to begin our food safari – in the heart of the home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> At this point in history, we seem busier than ever. We outsource everything, including our food preparation. The definition of ‘cooking’ for the modern man or woman appears to include taking out a packet of pre-made ravioli and pre-made pasta sauce, heating them up and covering them with pre-grated cheese. This is a far cry from the home preparation of stocks, breads and other foods that our great-grandparents would have been involved in daily.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Previous generations were raised knowing where their food came from. They probably visited or lived on the farms where their fruit and vegetables grew, maybe even picked them from their own backyard, preserving the excess bounty as jams and pickles to be eaten in the months that followed. Not yet dictated to by a global market, they would have eaten seasonally, knowing that winter is a time for grounding root vegetable stews, and that spring brings the sweetest green peas and juicy lamb chops. Sadly for 21st-century generations, we’ve completely lost touch with our earth’s seasonal wisdom and how it provides our body with exactly the nutrients and life forces it needs to flourish through the extremes.</p>
