<h2><strong>Now, How Should Your Minimalist Kitchen Be?</strong></h2>



<p> In the kitchen, it is common to accumulate accessories and decorations, some more useful than others. However, through minimalism, the tendency now is to achieve functional and sober kitchen environment that gives the sensation of order and harmony. Below, we are going to outline some characteristics that you can consider for your minimalist kitchen.</p>



<h4>Feature #1: Utility and practicality</h4>



<p> One of the first characteristics of a minimalist kitchen is the functionality. All kitchens must have an area of work where to cut, chop, whip and clean to make the task more efficient. This is why keeping a clear countertop is the first step to follow.</p>



<h4>Feature #2: Covered and stored appliances</h4>



<p> Some appliances that are not used on a daily basis such as grinder or Blender must be stored inside a cupboard so they are not in sight. The same goes with utensils and cutlery, which must be saved, but in an accessible place, for practical use of them when it comes to cooking and eating.</p>



<h4>Feature #3: Housekeeping</h4>



<p> Cleaning after every meal is essential for the provision of a neat and harmonious appearance. This detail will not only allow you to have a more minimalist space but also present you and your family comfort in your home.</p>



<h4>Feature #4: uncluttered space (for small spaces)</h4>



<p> To get the feeling of harmony and order it is important to have uncluttered spaces, no objects in the middle, especially if you do not have a large space. In addition, you must opt for simple geometries of straight lines in countertops, Islands, and cupboards.</p>



<h4>Feature #5: The colors of minimalism</h4>



<p> White is the color par excellence of the minimalism that gives an excellent result. In chairs, high or worktops of granite you can look for contrast and create harmony in the space. For example, you can combine white with grey and black. Also, the white floor and utensils in this tone, are the best choice to give light and beautiful ambience to the room.</p>



<p> Avoid colors like yellow, Orange and Brown.</p>



<h4>Feature #6: The cupboard</h4>



<p> The cupboards should be large and of practical design to keep all the utensils and cutlery neatly in place. It is common to finish with a shiny lacquer and straight lines on the doors, without any adornment and in neutral tones, mainly white.</p>



<h4>Feature #7: Appliances and furniture</h4>



<p> For the sink, the oven and the refrigerator, stainless steel is the best option, and the ceramic hob can be black on a white countertop.</p>



<p> The islands are a constant of this style with white chairs without backrest or with a black metal backrest to contrast.</p>



<h2>Some Tricks For Your Minimalist Kitchen</h2>



<h4>Trick #1: Kitchen islands</h4>



<p> If we talk about things that are fashionable for kitchens, you must have that clear: the Islands. We cannot define exactly the key to its success. But, the truth is that people who test it often become unrepentant.</p>



<ul><li> Islands better distribute the space in the kitchen.</li><li> They serve as a separator between the kitchen and dining room.</li><li> They allow you to move through them in one way more simple.</li><li> The Islands can be defined spaces, superior, where the countertop provides you a great area of work, and the bottom, perfect storage space to store dishes and other kitchen utensils.</li></ul>



<h4>Trick # 2: The order</h4>



<p> If there is something that attracts people to minimalism, it is precisely the sense of order that it gives to the kitchen. In the minimalist kitchen, there should be an almost total absence of accessories and furniture without handles.</p>



<h4>Trick # 3: Lighting</h4>



<p> The lights integrated into the furniture are a great success and if you decide to put them in your kitchen you will surely love the result. It facilitates the search for kitchen tools and also illuminates the rest of the room with charm and elegance.</p>



<p> With regard to lighting, it is very important in minimalist kitchens. A good combination of colors favor the lighting of the space. Strengthen the entrance of external light and think well about the distribution of the furniture so that they do not hinder its entrance. The cupboards with transparent doors for the tableware are perfect the most of spaces. Lighting should be white and modern light.</p>
