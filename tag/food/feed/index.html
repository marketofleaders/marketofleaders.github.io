<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Dining Out</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1.jpg" alt="dining-out" class="wp-image-678" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dining-out-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> When we want to get together with someone, what do we usually say? How about lunch? Let’s get together for dinner? Face it, a lot of socializing takes place over a meal. How do you deal with that when you’re on a diet? For myself, I dealt with it much the same way as everything else—head on.<br> One of the things I did when I was dieting was to make sure that I ate breakfast—in fact, many mornings I would have a rather large breakfast. Many evenings I was able to eat a light dinner, by reminding myself that I would be having a large, satisfying breakfast in the morning. Consequently, a get together with friends for a big breakfast on the weekends worked out very well for me.<br> If I was meeting someone in the evening, it required discipline. It wasn’t impossible, because I had taken ownership of my goal. I would usually have a large salad and drinks. I didn’t really limit myself when it came to drinks. For the most part, I only drank when I went out and usually two or three. Today, I probably drink more because I’ll have a drink at home too. Just because my diet and exercise are a lifestyle doesn’t mean I deny myself anything. In fact, I feel that because I don’t deny myself what I want, I’m able to maintain my diet and exercise lifestyle.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> Rituals</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Sharing food is a custom that we have in our society, in and around social interactions. The food is not the main thing, the people you are with is really what matters. You can meet someone for lunch and have lousy food, yet still have a good time because of the social interaction over the meal. The reverse is also true. You can have great food and a lousy time. The food itself is really not that important when it comes to socializing.<br> I have a story about a social gathering that illustrates some of our feelings around food. Many years ago, when I was very fat, I was at a dinner party of about a dozen people. The food was very good and everyone was enjoying the event. The food was placed on serving plates on a large table that we all sat around. One of the particularly tasty dishes went very fast, except for one piece, the last piece. I was looking at the last piece and I really wanted it. However, there was a part of me that just couldn’t take it and it appeared that no one else was able to take it either. I happened to be sitting across from a psychologist, so I thought I would ask him why it is that most people won’t take the last piece. He told me something very interesting. He said that when people are in a group, they are self-conscious of appearing greedy. Most people feel that if they take the last piece of something, they will look greedy. When he said that, I promptly took the last piece and enjoyed it very much. What I found interesting is that it’s not a matter of actually being greedy—it’s a matter of appearing greedy. It seems clear to me that we are very concerned with how we appear in social situations, and there are a whole lot of unspoken rules that we follow, whether they make sense or not. Perhaps at one time they did make sense, but, at this point, they are just rituals that we go through because we feel this is how we will be accepted by the group.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> What’s the most important thing about socializing with others? It’s the socializing itself, not the food you eat while socializing. Why is it, then, that food enters into the situation so frequently? Have you ever played poker? When you play poker, obviously the most important thing is the card game itself. However, if you only pay attention to the cards, you will probably lose. The cards are important, but cards do not play the game, people play the game. If you don’t pay attention to the people, you’ll miss half the game. No matter how good some of the players are, they can only play the cards they are dealt. How they play the cards they’re dealt is what separates the winners from the losers. It’s not just a matter of bluffing when you have a lousy hand, although that’s certainly part of it. It’s also knowing when it’s not worth it, and it’s time to fold, so that you are still able to play the next hand. If you’re playing poker, and are not paying attention to these things in your opponents and yourself, then you are at a disadvantage. It’s not always easy to spot what your opponents are thinking or doing in the middle of a game. Something every good player looks for in their opponents are tells. Tells are subconscious cues that your opponents give off, like tapping their foot when they’re bluffing. Tells are usually not that obvious.<br> In fact, they almost never are. Sometimes you may not even realize that you are picking up on them, but you will still react to them. That’s where poker and socializing with food overlap.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>The Food Pusher</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Only the odd time does food become an issue when socializing, but only with a particular type of person and I think we’ve all met that person. They are what I call the food pusher. Your parents are not going to change unless they want to change. Since they are, by their nature, older than you are, don’t hold your breath.<br> The food pushers are the people who will not take no for an answer and they come in two general varieties, overtly aggressive and passive aggressive.<br> The overtly aggressive food pusher is the person who keeps dumping food on your plate that you did not ask for, and may not even like. Then, in a loud booming voice they say, “Eat!!!” The overtly aggressive food pusher actually means well and is usually trying to be hospitable. They are usually people who only know how to communicate using the language of aggression. Because of the way that they communicate, these people have to be dealt with in a firm manner.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Treating</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Getting back to run-of-the-mill socializing—socializing over a meal should not be an issue if you have taken ownership of your weight. You may not have control over every craving that you have, or all the whacked out food pushers out there. However, there’s nothing that says you can’t indulge in a little treating as opposed to cheating. The idea is that you are allowing yourself an indulgence, as opposed to giving in to a craving or someone dumping food on your plate.<br> There is a big difference. As the owner of your weight, you have control, even when you decide to go off your diet as a treat or celebration. There’s nothing to feel guilty about, even if your indulgence results in the gain of a pound or two.<br> First of all, you’ll be weighing yourself regularly so you will be aware of the situation long before it snowballs into a larger problem. Secondly, you will have the tools to address the situation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Enjoy Your Food With Others/Avoid Binging On Your Own</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> I have always loved food and I still do. However, for the most part, I did the majority of my serious eating on my own. In other words, I didn’t pig out in front of other people in a social situation. In fact, I compensated to the point that I would usually eat much less than normal in social situations. It’s okay to enjoy your food in social situations.<br> If you’re like me, the only person holding you back from enjoying your food is yourself. <br> It has to do with your attitude towards food—food is something we all need, so the idea of not eating is simply not realistic. Okay, we’ve established that you have to eat. You need energy to sustain your body.<br> That’s the need aspect of food. However, when we talk about loving food and enjoying food in a social situation, we’re talking about the want aspect of food.<br> When someone is starving to death, chocolate cheesecake is not really what they need. Chocolate cheesecake usually falls into the want column, but not always. In certain situations, it can be a need. However, that is very unusual.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> <strong>Balance</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> You shouldn’t deny yourself an opportunity to participate in something any more than you should deny your desire for good food. Many times, the hardest thing is the anticipation. For myself, I noticed that my fears were always worst before an event, when I was by myself. I found people very accepting and, in some cases, quite encouraging. We tend to get worked up over something not very serious and make it seem much worse than it is.<br> What I’ve found is that many people are more concerned with the drama in their own lives to consider the drama we’ve worked up in our own minds. This shows us that too much subjective thinking will give us a distorted view of the way things really are. By the same token, too much objective thinking is not the way to go either. We can’t simply deny the way we feel, any more than we can deny our desire to be loved, be liked, and enjoy our food. What I’m saying is that we need to find a balance between subjective and objective thinking.<br> Finding a balance will help us deal with our weight problem, and help us to feel more comfortable socializing with others in situations that involve food. It’s not impossible, but it can initially seem a bit cumbersome. I found that I had to consciously think my way through it at first. Sometimes I still need to consciously achieve a balance in my thinking, so I don’t get myself too worked up.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> Child to an Adult</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Socializing is all about our need to interact and to be liked by others. Our greatest fear is rejection. As a fat person, I faced rejection many times. If you’re fat, you know exactly what I’m talking about. However, it’s important to remember that we choose to be fat and we can choose to be thin. It’s not a surprise to us that, as a fat person, we will face some rejection, so, in some way, we choose that rejection. Here’s an interesting question: Why would anyone choose to be rejected? There could be any number of reasons and, as I’ve said before, I’m not a therapist of any sort, so I’m really not qualified to answer that question. However, I have been in that position and I can tell you that some part of me didn’t want to be accepted by the group. I think it has something to do with my home environment while I was growing up. Now, I could sit here and whine about all the problems my parents inflicted on me, but if I did, I would still be fat and facing rejection. I would just be living in victim mode and clinging to that pain to keep me company. Not only that, but I would also be living like a child, carrying around all the hurts I’ve ever faced. At a certain point, it is time to be your own person and start acting like an adult. The key word is not adult—the key word is act, because it’s time to take action. That’s how adults face their problems.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Relationship Dynamics</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> When it comes to people you know well, you may have to face some challenges. I knew of a couple, the husband was thin and the wife was fat. The husband would buy his wife chocolates because he liked his wife fat. Why he liked his wife fat, I don’t know. I have my own theories about his insecurities, but really I don’t know. He may have been a food pusher. All I know is that he bought the chocolates and his wife ate the chocolates—remember, no one can force an adult to do anything. People can talk about social pressure and all kinds of other bullshit, but the bottom line is: if you don’t want to do something, you don’t have to. Perhaps their relationship wasn’t the healthiest, but there was something there that worked for both of them.<br> Now, imagine if, one day, the woman said no to her husband’s chocolates, what then? Well, I think it’s pretty obvious that her refusal of the chocolates would throw a wrench into the dynamic. A refusal like that would mean that something would have to change. Either the husband would have to get used to the fact that his wife no longer wanted his chocolates and to be fat, or the wife would have to change her mind and accept the chocolates. Now, the husband may accept that his wife no longer wants his gifts of chocolates, but he may not like it. If he is unhappy with his wife’s refusal of the chocolates, chances are he’s going to express it. Nothing exists in a vacuum. Until this point, from his view, his wife was happy to accept his chocolates, so now he feels rejected. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Berries</strong> are tiny colorful fruits that are packed full of fiber,minerals and vitamins. Although there are a lot of different kinds, among the most popular ones are blueberries, strawberries,blackberries, and raspberries.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">.<br> ● <strong>Fish</strong> are a great source of protein. Everybody knows this.They also long-chains of omega-3 fatty acids. Although all types of fish contain some amount of omega-3 fatty acids, salmon, herring,mackerel, sardines, and anchovies are among the best sources. These kinds of fish are known to reduce inflammation that can cause metabolic syndrome, hepatitis, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.<br> When you eat fish, your body system breaks down these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have antiinflammatory effects. During clinical research, people consuming salmon or omega-3 fatty acid supplements had decreases in certain inflammatory markers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg" alt="Broccoli " class="wp-image-577" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Broccoli </strong>First of all, broccoli is highly nutritious. It is a cruciferous vegetable, along with some other veggies like cauliflower, brussels sprouts and kale. Studies have shown that consuming a generous amount of cruciferous veggies has been linked with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer.<br> This is believed to be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain. Broccoli also contains sulforaphane, an antioxidant that reduces inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and other proinflammatory substances which drive inflammation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg" alt="Avocados " class="wp-image-578" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Avocados </strong>Accept it. Avocado is a superfood worthy of the title. I never liked avocados growing up. They were green and tasted weird. But I discovered certain benefits of avocados and put some work into trying out various recipes I might like. I discovered a few but trust that there are certain ways I will never eat an avocado.<br> They are filled with potassium, magnesium, fiber and healthy monounsaturated fats, and they also contain certain compounds called carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to the reduction of cancer risks. In addition, certain compounds in avocados may reduce inflammation in young skin cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In one study, people were asked to consume a slice of avocado with a hamburger. After a period of time, it was discovered that they had lower levels of the inflammatory markers than participants who ate just the hamburger.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg" alt="Green tea" class="wp-image-579" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Green tea</strong> Everybody drinks one green tea or another these days.I don&#8217;t blame them,It has immense benefits. You&#8217;ve probably heard that green tea is one of the healthiest drinks you can take. It is known to reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, obesity and other inflammatory problems. Many of its benefits are due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances it contains, especially a substance known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).EGCG reduces inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. It also prevents damage to the fatty acids in your cells. Varieties of green teas can be found in stores all around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg" alt="Peppers" class="wp-image-580" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Peppers</strong> don&#8217;t exactly feel or taste pleasant. Despite the flavour they add to certain meals, they are known for a signature burn, some more than others. They have anti-inflammatory properties and that make them an essential in our diet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bell peppers and chili peppers are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants that inhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Bell peppers contain the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce at least one marker of oxidative damage in people with an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis. Chili peppers contain compounds like sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which can reduce inflammation and lead to more life expectancy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg" alt="Mushrooms" class="wp-image-581" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Mushrooms </strong>are those adorable little umbrella plants that are believed to house pixies and while hundreds of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible. Others are poisonous.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trick to being able to differentiate between good mushrooms and bad mushrooms lies somewhere on Google. You should find it. To save you the trouble, the good mushrooms include truffles,portobello mushrooms, and shiitake.<br> Mushrooms are considered to be very low in calories but rich in selenium, copper and the entire B vitamin family. They are also packed with phenols and other antioxidants that provide antiinflammatory aid. A special kind of mushroom called lion&#8217;s mane may potentially reduce the low-grade inflammation seen in obese individuals. Also, one study found that cooking mushrooms lowered their anti-inflammatory compounds so it may be best to eat them raw.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg" alt="Grape" class="wp-image-582" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Grape </strong>Round, beautiful, tasty and apparently, anti-inflammatory.Grapes contain substances like anthocyanins which reduce inflammation. Also, they can decrease the risk of several diseases,including heart problems, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and some eye disorders.<br> Grapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol, another substance known for its many health benefits. In one study, people with heart problems consumed grape extract daily and experienced a significant decrease in inflammatory gene markers. Another interesting fact is that their levels of adiponectin increased. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg" alt="Turmeric " class="wp-image-583" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Turmeric </strong>is a yellow or orange spice with a strong,earthy flavor that is often used in curries and other Indian dishes. It has received a lot of attention for its content of the powerful antiinflammatory substance called curcumin. Turmeric is proven to be effective at reducing the inflammation related to hepatitis, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Turmeric is THE superfood of superfoods!<br> A study showed that one gram of curcumin everyday mixed with piperine from black pepper caused a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP in people with metabolic syndrome. The problem however is that it may be hard to get enough curcumin to have a noticeable effect from just turmeric. It needs to be combined with other substances to get the full experience. In one study, obese women who took 2.8 grams of turmeric everyday had no improvement whatsoever in inflammatory markers.<br> If you can&#8217;t seem to find anything to combine turmeric with, taking supplements containing isolated curcumin is also effective.<br> Curcumin supplements are usually combined with piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by a lot! Turmeric is also used as a face mask for skin inflammation, but it is not as effective on its own as it will be when mixed with other things like milk, lemon, honey, oatmeal, and so on.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong>, is one of the healthiest kinds of fat you can eat. It is rich in monounsaturated fats and an essential in the Mediterranean diet, which provides immense health benefits. Research links extra virgin olive oil to a significantly reduced risk of heart disease, brain cancer and other major health conditions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lovely green goodness<br> In one Mediterranean diet study, some inflammatory markers significantly decreased in those who consumed 50 ml of olive oil daily. The effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, can been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or diclofenac. Don&#8217;t forget that anti-inflammatory benefits are much greater in extra virgin olive oil than in more refined olive oils. It&#8217;s very easy to find extra virgin olive oil in your neighbourhood grocery store, but you can also buy it online.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg" alt="Dark chocolate" class="wp-image-585" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Dark chocolate</strong> Chocolate as an anti-inflammatory food? Oh yeah! Dark chocolate is absolutely delicious, rich, satisfying and a way for life for some good folks like myself. It is also loaded with antioxidants that reduce inflammation. Dark chocolate can actually reduce your risk of inflammation and heart disease.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dark chocolate! My precioussssss.<br>
Flavanols &#8211; the anti-inflammatory substance in dark chocolate &#8211; are responsible for chocolate&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effects and keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy. In one clinical study, smokers experienced significant improvement in endothelial function few hours after eating chocolate that&#8217;s high in flavonol. Make sure to always choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa -more is always better &#8211; in order to get the anti-inflammatory benefits.<br>
You can buy that chocolate bar now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg" alt="Tomatoes " class="wp-image-586" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Tomatoes </strong>The tomato is another superfood. It is high in nutrients and has many healing properties include fixing sunburns!<br> Tomatoes are very high in vitamin C, potassium and lycopene, the antioxidant with impressive anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is also particularly beneficial for reducing pro-inflammatory compounds related to several kinds of cancer.<br> Clinical studies have determined that drinking tomato juice significantly decreased inflammatory markers in overweight women.<br> It doesn&#8217;t work as much in obese women though.Cooking tomatoes in olive oil can maximize the amount of lycopene available for absorption. What did you expect from the combination of two very powerful anti inflammatory foods? Tomatoes can be eaten raw or cooked. They&#8217;re a key component of pasta sauce, vegetable salad,sandwiches and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg" alt="Cinnamon " class="wp-image-587" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Cinnamon </strong>is a very delicious spice with a distinctive smell. It contains a compound called cinnamaldehyde which is responsible for inhibiting certain proteins such as actin and C-reactive protein, which can lead to inflammation.<br> Cinnamaldehyde also works by stopping unwanted agglutination of blood platelets that can lead to inflammation by sending signals for the release of arachidonic acid and reducing the formation of thromboxane A2. Too much cinnamon may cause breathing difficulties so take it in moderation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1768" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Ginger </strong>Apart from being a delicious addition to a wide range of meals, ginger is stacked with a lot of health benefits beyond inflammation. It is known to improve metabolism and help fight oxidative damage. Studies have shown that the compounds gingerol and zingerone found in ginger are solely responsible for the root&#8217;s ability to fight inflammation. They have been linked to reductions in many forms of inflammation, from colitis to kidney damage to diabetes and hepatitis.<br> The absolute best way to consume ginger is to eat the raw root.Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. Although it may be difficult for your body to break down the fiber, it is the best way to get all the anti-inflammatory substances absorbed into your body. However, for the faint of heart, it is also available in powder and supplement form.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1769" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hamburger-2683042_1280-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lots of us believe that we eat our feelings and <em>need to get some control goddammit</em>. But what is actually even more common, and way more detrimental, is using <em>dieting and control</em> to numb our feelings.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dieting is one of the big ways we try to avoid feeling our bodies. It is a perfect storm of distraction, control, perfectionism, and the chemical high we get from adrenaline and other stress hormones when we restrict our food.Dieting is a way to disconnect us from our bodies and stifle our life force. <em>Less</em> food and <em>higher</em> stress hormones help us temporarily live with less feeling, not to mention all of the concentration and focus it takes to override your appetite and famine response. Dieting is a distraction.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">All of the following tools and exercises are devoted to help you begin feeling. You are going to be doing enough work on habitually feeling emotions, and when you do that, emotional eating will lose its power. When you are committed to feeling emotions, the coping mechanisms you’ve used naturally begin to take a healthier role in your life.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We become dysfunctional with food, and it’s not usually because of emotional eating at all. It’s because of restriction, guilt, and the biological survival cycle that it induces—and also because of our deep fear of weight and taking up space. As long as you are getting out of reactive famine mode, <em>and</em> learning to feel instead of numb, you don’t need to worry about emotional eating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do not get stuck in the trap of worrying that you need to stop emotionally eating—that will become restriction. Just eat and feel. I also want to remind you that eating is never a problem in and of itself. Shift your attention instead to making sure you aren’t trying to numb or distract yourself with control, perfectionism, and <em>dieting</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s also important to note that emotional eating and bingeing aren’t the same thing. In all of my experience working with so many, manyyyy people who believed that emotional eating was their problem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. once they stopped restricting, they were able to see that emotional eating was not actually their <em>core</em> problem at all. Emotional eating is not the reason most people are so dysfunctional with food. The problem is the biological famine response and the yo-yo of restriction, which leads to bingeing. That is the thing to fix if you want to become normal with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even if you worry that you tend to eat to numb, the answer is still never to restrict, because that will just start up the yo-yo again. In the physical part of the process (and always) the answer is eating. The answer now is also feeling.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The truth is, eating emotionally is actually perfectly healthy and normal. All humans eat emotionally. Your cravings and your body’s needs are directly affected by your mental state and your stress levels. You are <em>meant</em> to have the option to comfort yourself with food. You are not a robot eating battery pellets for energy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Food is fuel and nutrition, but it is also allowed to be comforting and grounding. And eating food to comfort and fill you up or to connect with others is a <em>nonissue</em> when you’re not in a reactive binge/repent cycle. When you are actually feeding yourself and trusting your body, <em>and</em> your body actually trusts that it is being fed, comfort eating can just be a part of a very normal relationship with food.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, eating birthday cake is an emotional reason to eat food: celebration. And eating a big bowl of macaroni and cheese when you are tired and sad is a legitimate way to comfort and feed yourself.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating will happen. It is part of being human. It is part of being a normal eater. It is part of assessing what we need in any given moment and trying to comfort ourselves. That will always be okay. The more neutral food becomes, the more your body will naturally, without thinking about it, balance and account for times when we eat emotionally or “more than we need.” That’s what a healthy balanced body and appetite does. You don’t need to do <em>anything</em> about it. Just eat. Just listen. Just trust that this eating thing <em>ain’t that deep</em>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional eating <em>is not bingeing</em>. The problem only comes when you feel guilty about emotional eating. <em>That</em> triggers the guilt-and-repent cycle: Feeling guilty for eating. Deciding to restrict a little to make up for it. Then all hell breaks loose. Then you’re back in the yo-yo. The bottom line is, don’t feel guilty about eating, because that will only perpetuate your dysfunction with food.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve pulled together a list here of the basic commonsense eating guidelines I live by. Instead of being motivated by the fear of negative consequences, why not try to implement one or more of these in your life?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/architecture-assorted-booth-2448765.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1771" width="563" height="620" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/architecture-assorted-booth-2448765.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/architecture-assorted-booth-2448765-272x300.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></figure></div>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong> Eat mostly plants<br>Despite the vast differences in doctrine between the mainstream and alternative nutrition experts, the one thing we can all agree on is that eating plant foods is really good. I like to ensure that plant foods – such as nuts, seeds, fruits, grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa, buckwheat), fruits, sea vegetables, herbs and spices – make up the majority of my diet, with the greatest emphasis on seasonal vegetables and especially greens. I still enjoy animal products such as meat, eggs, fish, cheese, butter and ghee, but in smaller quantities.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2</strong> Avoid processed foods where you can<br>Industrially produced foods that your ancestors wouldn’t comprehend are best eaten in small amounts. Any ingredient with a number, or a name that doesn’t register as ‘food’ when you read it, probably isn’t food. Stick to things that are foods, in as natural a state as possible. If a laboratory or factory has done most of the preparation, it’s probably better to leave it on the supermarket shelf.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>3</strong> Live by the 80:20 rule<br>Sticking to your nutritional values 80 per cent of the time will allow you a healthy margin where you can say yes to the chocolate cake at your friends’ birthday parties, or enjoy a big slab of pizza as you travel through Naples. There are food opportunities in life that just can’t be ignored or turned down. Don’t be that killjoy. Allowing yourself the space to stray from your regular nourishing eating habits will help you not to take yourself too seriously, and will bring freedom to your social food situations. Twenty per cent indulgence won’t do you any harm if you’re otherwise healthy.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>4</strong> Balance out your eating<br>Eating is all about balance. If you’ve been out of your normal routine while at work or on holidays and found you’ve overindulged in a specific food, spend the next few days nourishing yourself back to homoeostasis (metabolic balance) with the foods you’ve been missing. If you’ve spent a few days eating lots of starchy, cooked foods, for example, it might be a good idea to spend a couple of days eating some raw and lighter foods through vegie juices, salads and vegetable soups.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>5</strong> Take an Ayurvedic approach<br>Traditional  Ayurvedic medicine teaches us that we attain health when we eat a practical balance of different types of foods from the taste categories of bitter, sweet, sour, salty, astringent and pungent.Having a varied diet of different tastes,eating seasonally, and ensuring the right balance of cooked and cold foods helps the nervous system recognise nourishment.

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>6</strong> Choose quality over quantity<br>This is especially true with animal products. Overall, try to invest in better-quality food that’s chemical-free or organic. Shop at local farmers’ markets rather than supermarkets if possible. With animal products, look for organic or 100 per cent grass-fed and grass-finished. It’s better to enjoy smaller amounts of quality food than gorging on food that’s cheap and of lower quality.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In a supercharged kitchen, true nourishment begins. There’s so much potential, wherever you live, to create memories of love and hospitality that will linger in the imagination of your family and friends. The kitchen is where your food culture is established, where you decide on and store the kinds of ingredients you wish to share with your loved ones. You can either have a pantry full of pre-packaged foods, or a wondrous landscape of individual, fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients waiting to be combined into fulfilling, wholesome meals.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Many people find the kitchen a stressful place to be; some even despise cooking, preferring to fork out money for a convenient takeaway meal. The problem with this is you’re not just paying for the food, you’re paying for a business. The way many restaurant and take away businesses make their money is by minimizing expenditure to increase their profit margin; in other words, they buy cheap, low-quality ingredients, make them taste good by coating them in additive-laden sauces and seasonings, then sell each dish at a price that allows their staff, rent and bills to be paid, with some extra on top for the business owners. I’d much rather put my money towards quality, ethically produced ingredients sourced from local producers and farmers’ markets, add a little kitchen work and enjoy a meal that’s better on my wallet, better for the planet, and better for my body and my family. You? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Food is at the heart of the home, and cooking is the vehicle to ensure a healthier and happier society. Michael Pollan famously addresses what he calls ‘a curious paradox’ around food in his book Cooked, where he observes that his fellow Americans seem to be devoting more time to thinking about food than ever before. An increasing interest in TV shows about food and cooking coincides with a collective disengagement from real food and the act of cooking in the home. With more meals prepared outside the home thanks to industrial food production, it seems the less Americans cook, the more interesting they find food and its preparation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> If we’re so transfixed by cooking that we spend hours gazing at, thinking about and observing it in the media, why as a society do we value our own kitchens so little? It’s time we began to fall in love with the instinctive, natural, utterly human behaviour of cooking once again, and we can only fall in love with our kitchens when we rekindle our love for food. Food is central to the seven keystones of life, as discussed earlier, and this is where we need to begin our food safari – in the heart of the home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> At this point in history, we seem busier than ever. We outsource everything, including our food preparation. The definition of ‘cooking’ for the modern man or woman appears to include taking out a packet of pre-made ravioli and pre-made pasta sauce, heating them up and covering them with pre-grated cheese. This is a far cry from the home preparation of stocks, breads and other foods that our great-grandparents would have been involved in daily.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Previous generations were raised knowing where their food came from. They probably visited or lived on the farms where their fruit and vegetables grew, maybe even picked them from their own backyard, preserving the excess bounty as jams and pickles to be eaten in the months that followed. Not yet dictated to by a global market, they would have eaten seasonally, knowing that winter is a time for grounding root vegetable stews, and that spring brings the sweetest green peas and juicy lamb chops. Sadly for 21st-century generations, we’ve completely lost touch with our earth’s seasonal wisdom and how it provides our body with exactly the nutrients and life forces it needs to flourish through the extremes.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take a fresh look at salads and you’ll see there are a lot of exciting developments in the salad bowl. Banished forever is the image of salads as dull diet food consisting of little more than limp lettuce and soggy, flavorless tomatoes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today, salads are one of the ultimate health foods. They can contain an exciting variety of colorful, delicious, and satisfying ingredients that provide the nutrients essential for healthy living. Remember, salads aren’t just for summer. We have plenty of ideas for salads that brighten and lighten winter mealtimes, too. In fact, once you get into the habit of thinking “salad” while menu planning, ideas will also come to you whatever the time of the year as you push your shopping cart along the supermarket aisles or stop at the cheese counter or produce department.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
are versatile enough to cater for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Meat,
seafood, and poultry are ideal salad ingredients, along with the perhaps more
commonly used lettuce and other leaves, vegetables, fruit, herbs, nuts, seeds,
grains, legumes, and cheese. And with so many ingredients to choose from,
salads can be as simple and light or complex and filling as you like. They also
have the added bonus that they are versatile enough to fit easily into all your
meal plans, from first courses through to desserts.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of </p>

you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of
chicken salad doesn’t excite because you’ve been making the same recipe out of
habit for as long as you can remember, try Thai-Style Chicken Salad. You’ll
never think of chicken salad as humdrum again!</p>



<h1>Bowls of Goodness</h1>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It
wasn’t long ago that when “salads” and “health” were linked it was in the
context of weight-reducing diets that were restrictive and ultimately
unsatisfying. Today, however, salads are a delicious component of a healthy
diet, giving you endless variety at mealtimes without long hours in the
kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">With
fresh produce from all corners of the globe readily available in supermarkets
and gourmet food stores, you can enjoy a variety of salads all year round but,
remember, salads are at their most flavorsome and nutritious when made with
seasonal produce in its prime.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We
are all being urged to eat more fruit and vegetables every day, and a salad a
day can go a long way to help you meet the minimum target of 2½ cups for
adults. Enjoy a bowl of Traditional Greek Salad or Three-Color Salad, for
example, and you’ll be more than halfway to success. What could be easier—or
more enjoyable?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
also make great accompaniments, served alongside a filling bowl of pasta or a
plate of hot or cold roast meat.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green leaves with a simple oil-and-vinegar dressing, it’s definitely time to think again. And don’t make the mistake of thinking all salad ingredients have to be raw, either. Adding small amounts of cooked meat, poultry and seafood to lettuce leaves and other vegetables gives you a satisfying meal. If you want a meal-in-a-bowl, try Roast Pork with Pumpkin, Smoked Chicken Salad with Avocado &amp; Tarragon Dressing, and Shrimp &amp; Rice Salad, for example. There are plenty of vegetarian main-course salads, too, such as the Middle Eastern favorite Tabbouleh and Buckwheat Noodle Salad with Smoked Tofu.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cooked vegetables also make good salad ingredients. Grilled peppers, fried eggplants, blanched beans of all varieties, and peas are just some of the cooked vegetables.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">So,
if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green
