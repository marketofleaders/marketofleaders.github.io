<p> I’ve always felt that if food isn’t delicious, it isn’t worth eating. Healthy eating doesn’t mean going on fad diets—or even following a strict diet at all.</p>



<p> It’s about focusing on deliciously satisfying foods that nourish your body and soul—and making them a priority.</p>



<h3> The Golden Principles of Healthy Eating</h3>



<p> So, what is healthy eating? For starters, it means focusing on fresh, whole foods with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables, often referred to as clean eating. It also means choosing unrefined whole grains, such as whole-wheat flour, brown rice, and oats, over more processed options.</p>



<p> When you do venture into those inner aisles for items such as canned beans, packaged chicken stock, or spices, be sure to check the labels. Avoid chemicals and artificial flavors, and monitor for salt and added sugars.</p>



<p> Buy the best quality food you can easily afford—it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers. When it makes sense, look for organic produce and buy meat, dairy, and eggs from sustainable and local sources whose animals are raised humanely and without antibiotics, growth hormones, and other unnecessary restrictions such as being caged.</p>



<h3> The Logistical Challenge</h3>



<p> When you make the commitment to healthier eating habits, you’ll naturally want more control over the quality of the food you eat. That’s difficult when you’re relying on other people to prepare your food, whether it’s in the form of take-out meals or even prepared items from the grocery store. Prepared healthy, clean-eating options can be found, but they tend to be expensive.</p>



<p> The best and most cost-effective way to eat healthy is to make your own meals at home from whole, fresh ingredients. I get how challenging that can seem. We’re all busy; we get home late, and we’re tired. Throw in homework, laundry, after-school or after-work activities and who has the time to cook? Just the idea of cooking can be overwhelming—not to mention that endless pile of dishes that needs to be washed when you’re done.</p>



<p> Even though logistical challenges exist, healthy eating should be a priority. Along with physical activity, it’s crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. When I eat well, I feel better—and I have more energy.</p>



<h3> The One-Pot Solution</h3>



<p> Cooking dinner used to be the last thing I felt like doing after a long day. But once I discovered the beauty of one-pot cooking, my nightly routine was transformed. Now, instead of being tempted by take-out, I know a homemade meal made with nutritious ingredients is just a few minutes away. Plus, as there’s only one pot, cleanup is a breeze!</p>



<p> People have been making one-pot meals on their stovetops and in their ovens for decades, but modern kitchen appliances such as electric pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers make one-pot cooking easier—and healthier—than ever.</p>
