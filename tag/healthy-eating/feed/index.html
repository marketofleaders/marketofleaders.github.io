<p> In this article, I cover the basics and also let you in on some of best cooking and meal planning tips—from helpful hints on what ingredients to keep in your kitchen and which ones to avoid to fast prep solutions that will help you get meals on the table quickly. You’ll also learn five tricks to help you keep your portion sizes under control without feeling deprived. My approach to fuss-free weeknight cooking makes healthy eating a breeze.</p>



<h2> What to Eat</h2>



<p> Clean eating doesn’t mean you have to live off salads or that you can never eat dessert. It’s about focusing on real, minimally processed foods without added chemicals and cooking them in a way that uses healthy fats, herbs, and spices for a flavor boost. With that in mind, I’ve noted foods to enjoy to their fullest, those to limit to special occasions or enjoy in moderation, and foods to avoid when possible.</p>



<h4> ENJOY</h4>



<p> One of the best things about practicing clean eating is that you can enjoy most minimally processed, whole foods without limitation and without worrying about things like counting calories or tracking every bite you take. Bulk up your meals with ingredients like fresh fruits and vegetables; lean proteins such as fish, beans, and eggs; and nuts and seeds. You can also use herbs and spices, both fresh and dried, to add tons of flavor to your meals. If it doesn’t have an ingredient label or you can grow it in your garden, it likely belongs in this category. These ingredients should fill the majority of your plate. Additionally, try to incorporate them into your desserts and snacks as often as you can.</p>



<h4> LIMIT</h4>



<p> Some foods are okay in moderation, but, even though they’re generally healthy, they can quickly add a lot of calories to your plate if you aren’t careful. For the best success, limit sugars, including natural sugars such as honey and pure maple syrup, healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, and tahini, whole grains like brown rice and farro, and starchy vegetables like potatoes. Dairy and processed meats such as sausage or bacon also fall under this category, and always look for versions without added sugar, nitrates, or other additives. Use these ingredients to add a pop of flavor to your plate, but approach them as a treat to be enjoyed in small amounts.</p>



<h4> AVOID</h4>



<p> I’m not generally a fan of strict food rules or declaring certain foods off limits, but for long-term results, people who follow a clean-eating way of life should avoid some foods completely. This includes highly processed snacks and convenience food such as French fries and chips, commercially prepared cookies and pastries, and sugary drinks. You should also avoid artificial sweeteners—besides not having any nutritional value, studies have shown they can actually lead to overeating! Also be careful with low-fat and nonfat foods and check labels carefully. Some, like most fat-free Greek yogurts, are okay, but others are loaded with extra sugars and artificial ingredients to make up for the flavor and texture lost when removing the fat.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> HOW MUCH FOOD? A LOW-STRESS GUIDE TO PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>



<ul><li> <strong>Use a small plate.</strong> Ditch the dinner plate and use a salad plate instead. We eat with our eyes, and having a smaller plate that’s filled with food can seem more satisfying than the same amount of food presented on a larger plate.</li><li> <strong>Fill up with veggies.</strong> Vegetables are a healthy way to bulk up your meals, with their water and fiber content helping you feel full. Fill half your plate with vegetables or add a small side salad to your meal. You can also add fruits and vegetables to desserts. </li><li> <strong>Drink water.</strong> It’s easy to mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water, both with your meals and throughout the day, to stay satisfied. Aim for ½ to 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight per day.</li><li> <strong>Keep the leftovers in the kitchen</strong>. Instead of bringing everything to the table and eating family style, fix your plate in the kitchen and leave the leftovers there. That way, you’ll be less likely to have “just a little more.</li><li> <strong>Eat mindfully.</strong> Speaking of the table . . . eat there, not on the couch in front of the TV. You’ll be able to focus on enjoying your food without distraction and won’t accidentally finish everything on your plate without even realizing it—or tasting it.</li></ul>



<h2> Fast Prep Solutions</h2>



<p> The key to no-fuss cooking is all about being prepared. Here are some tips to help you prepare healthy recipes in a snap.</p>



<h4> Meal plan</h4>



<p> Spending a few minutes creating a plan for the week means no wasted time standing in front of the refrigerator wondering what to make and no extra trips to the grocery store for random ingredients you might not have.</p>



<h4> Batch cook</h4>



<p> Double or even triple recipes for pantry staples such as beans, rice and other grains, sauces, and stocks. They’ll keep in the refrigerator for a few days or frozen for longer-term storage. That way, you’ll have them ready to go when you need them.</p>



<h4> Embrace leftovers</h4>



<p> Cook once and eat twice! Make extra for dinner and enjoy leftovers for lunch the next day, or dinner again later in the week. You can also reimagine leftovers so you don’t get bored—enjoy Ratatouille as a side dish one night, then add it to pasta the next.</p>



<h4>Toss your peeler</h4>



<p> There’s no need to spend time peeling soft-skinned vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, or zucchini—just be sure to wash them well before cooking. And don’t worry about getting the perfect dice; just chop veggies to roughly the same size so they cook at the same pace.</p>



<h4>Plan ahead</h4>



<p> Mornings can be rushed, so I chop vegetables and measure any other ingredients for slow cooker meals the previous night. The next morning,  you only need to pull them out of the refrigerator, put them in the slow cooker, and turn it on!</p>



<h2>Refrigerator and Pantry Staples</h2>



<p> Stocking your kitchen with healthy foods, so everything is within easy reach and you’re not tempted by those chips or cookies, is one of the most important things you can do to set yourself up for weeknight cooking success. Following are some general ideas, but be sure to adapt them to your personal tastes—it doesn’t matter how much broccoli you have; if you don’t like it, you’ll never eat it.</p>



<h4> THE REFRIGERATOR</h4>



<p> <strong>Citrus fruits:</strong> Lemons and limes can be used in simple dressings and marinades and are an easy way to perk up flavors.</p>



<p> <strong>Fat-free Greek yogurt:</strong> Besides being an easy grab-and-go breakfast, you can use yogurt as a marinade for chicken or swirl it into soups and stews to add a creamy element or tone down spiciness.</p>



<p> <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> Herbs such as cilantro and basil add tons of instant flavor to simple recipes.</p>



<p> <strong>Green vegetables:</strong> Ingredients such as broccoli, zucchini, and bell peppers are a great starting place for most meals and mean a quick stir-fry is never far away.</p>



<p> <strong>Hard cheese:</strong> Hard cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Cheddar last a long time, and it only takes a little to add loads of flavor to your food.<br> Lean proteins: Quick-cooking lean proteins such as skinless chicken breast, shrimp, and eggs can be combined with other kitchen staples to create endless meal options.</p>



<p> <strong>Pizza dough:</strong> Pizza is delicious, but pizza dough can be used for so much more—bake it into rolls to go with soup, use it to make a meat pie, or turn it into cinnamon buns.</p>



<h4>THE PANTRY</h4>



<p> <strong>Canned tomatoes: </strong>Canned no-salt-added tomatoes are great in soups and stews, or for making a quick pasta sauce. I prefer fire-roasted varieties, which also add a subtle smoky element.</p>



<p> <strong>Dried herbs and spices: </strong>Pick one or two of your favorite international flavor profiles and stock up.<br> Having a variety of dried herbs and spices means you can make anything from Indian curries to Italian soups, even when fresh are not available.</p>



<p> <strong>Garlic and onions:</strong> Almost every recipe I make starts with at least one of these ingredients. I stock up every time I go to the grocery store.</p>



<p> <strong>Stock: </strong>I usually have homemade chicken and vegetable stock (see here and here) in my freezer, but I always keep a few cartons of low-sodium stock in the cabinet as backup. Use it to make a quick soup or add extra flavor to a pot of whole grains.</p>



<p> <strong>Whole grains:</strong> Rice, farro, and quinoa can form the base for many meals. Each has its own unique flavor, so I always have a good variety on hand to choose from.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Buy the best quality food you can easily afford, it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intuitive-Eating-For-Weight-Loss.jpg" alt="healthy eating" class="wp-image-988"/></figure></div>



<p> I’ve always felt that if food isn’t delicious, it isn’t worth eating. Healthy eating doesn’t mean going on fad diets—or even following a strict diet at all.</p>



<p> It’s about focusing on deliciously satisfying foods that nourish your body and soul—and making them a priority.</p>



<h3> The Golden Principles of Healthy Eating</h3>



<p> So, what is healthy eating? For starters, it means focusing on fresh, whole foods with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables, often referred to as clean eating. It also means choosing unrefined whole grains, such as whole-wheat flour, brown rice, and oats, over more processed options.</p>



<p> When you do venture into those inner aisles for items such as canned beans, packaged chicken stock, or spices, be sure to check the labels. Avoid chemicals and artificial flavors, and monitor for salt and added sugars.</p>



<p> Buy the best quality food you can easily afford—it tastes better and is less likely to have unnecessary additives and fillers. When it makes sense, look for organic produce and buy meat, dairy, and eggs from sustainable and local sources whose animals are raised humanely and without antibiotics, growth hormones, and other unnecessary restrictions such as being caged.</p>



<h3> The Logistical Challenge</h3>



<p> When you make the commitment to healthier eating habits, you’ll naturally want more control over the quality of the food you eat. That’s difficult when you’re relying on other people to prepare your food, whether it’s in the form of take-out meals or even prepared items from the grocery store. Prepared healthy, clean-eating options can be found, but they tend to be expensive.</p>



<p> The best and most cost-effective way to eat healthy is to make your own meals at home from whole, fresh ingredients. I get how challenging that can seem. We’re all busy; we get home late, and we’re tired. Throw in homework, laundry, after-school or after-work activities and who has the time to cook? Just the idea of cooking can be overwhelming—not to mention that endless pile of dishes that needs to be washed when you’re done.</p>



<p> Even though logistical challenges exist, healthy eating should be a priority. Along with physical activity, it’s crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. When I eat well, I feel better—and I have more energy.</p>



<h3> The One-Pot Solution</h3>



<p> Cooking dinner used to be the last thing I felt like doing after a long day. But once I discovered the beauty of one-pot cooking, my nightly routine was transformed. Now, instead of being tempted by take-out, I know a homemade meal made with nutritious ingredients is just a few minutes away. Plus, as there’s only one pot, cleanup is a breeze!</p>



<p> People have been making one-pot meals on their stovetops and in their ovens for decades, but modern kitchen appliances such as electric pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers make one-pot cooking easier—and healthier—than ever.</p>
