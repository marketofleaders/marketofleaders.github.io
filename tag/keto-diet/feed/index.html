<p> The word ‘ketogenic’ originated from ‘ketones,’ from which ‘keto’ is derived. Ketones are a small fuel molecule used as an alternative to providing sugar in the body when glucose (blood sugar) is short in supply. When you are low on carbs, your body goes through a metabolic state known as ketosis.</p>



<p> Ketosis is characterized by a rise in the level of ketones in the system. Here you start burning glucose due to the lack of energy. Keto diets, unlike other low-carb diets, are centered on this macronutrient which supplies about 90% of the body&#8217;s calories. Ketones are created from fats, and they provide energy to the whole body, particularly to the brain. The brain is the powerhouse of the human body, and it is always working. Even when you are asleep.</p>



<p> However, it cannot run directly on fat, unless it gets converted into either glucose or ketones.</p>



<p> Whenever there is a drop in the level of insulin in your body, the amount of fat that your system burns spikes because the stored fats become more accessible and make it easier for your body to utilize them. It is a fact that burning fat is one of the easiest ways to shed a few pounds. </p>



<p> This process is also beneficial for the body, in the sense that it gives you enough energy and reduces the number of times that you get hungry and helps you stay alert and focused throughout the day. When you are on a keto diet, your body begins to run on fat all day long, so it is perfect for getting your weight under your control since it burns fats 24/7.</p>



<p> Once you have decided to go on a keto diet, you should avoid too much protein because it can easily interfere with ketosis. That’s why you need to employ some tricks, as well as a conscious effort, to get the results you desire. </p>



<p> For instance, you must eat very low levels of carbohydrates in a day. Keep in mind that there are foods with extremely high levels of carbs, e.g., banana. There are about 27 grams of carbs in a medium sized banana. </p>



<p> When you start on a keto diet, you should also remember that reaching ketosis does not take place overnight. Retraining your liver to produce ketones is not an easy feat. It typically takes a few days to get to this metabolic state.</p>



<p> In summary, the keto diet is a low-carbohydrate diet, which is used to burn fat more easily and quickly by allowing you to consume more fats than carbohydrates. It follows a dietary plan of about 60 to 70% fat, 15 to 30% protein, and 5 to 10% carbs (Perfect Keto, n.d.).</p>



<p> Generally, it is considered to be safe for almost everybody, but there are some groups of people to whom special consideration should be given. Those on medication for diabetes or hypertension, as well as mothers that are breastfeeding, should consult with their doctor before starting any diet or lifestyle changes.</p>
