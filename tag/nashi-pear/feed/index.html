<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Berries</strong> are tiny colorful fruits that are packed full of fiber,minerals and vitamins. Although there are a lot of different kinds, among the most popular ones are blueberries, strawberries,blackberries, and raspberries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Berries are known to contain some antioxidants called anthocyanins.These substances have anti-inflammatory effects that will lower yourrisk of inflammation and disease. Your body&#8217;s immune system comprises of natural killer cells &#8211; NK cells &#8211; which help keep your body system functioning properly. Studies have shown that men and women who consumed berries had lower levels of certain inflammatory markers associated with inflammatory diseases</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg" alt="Fish" class="wp-image-576" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fish-food-market-96379-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">.<br> ● <strong>Fish</strong> are a great source of protein. Everybody knows this.They also long-chains of omega-3 fatty acids. Although all types of fish contain some amount of omega-3 fatty acids, salmon, herring,mackerel, sardines, and anchovies are among the best sources. These kinds of fish are known to reduce inflammation that can cause metabolic syndrome, hepatitis, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.<br> When you eat fish, your body system breaks down these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have antiinflammatory effects. During clinical research, people consuming salmon or omega-3 fatty acid supplements had decreases in certain inflammatory markers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg" alt="Broccoli " class="wp-image-577" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broccoli-1629643_1280-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Broccoli </strong>First of all, broccoli is highly nutritious. It is a cruciferous vegetable, along with some other veggies like cauliflower, brussels sprouts and kale. Studies have shown that consuming a generous amount of cruciferous veggies has been linked with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer.<br> This is believed to be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain. Broccoli also contains sulforaphane, an antioxidant that reduces inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and other proinflammatory substances which drive inflammation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg" alt="Avocados " class="wp-image-578" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avocado-2115922_1280-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Avocados </strong>Accept it. Avocado is a superfood worthy of the title. I never liked avocados growing up. They were green and tasted weird. But I discovered certain benefits of avocados and put some work into trying out various recipes I might like. I discovered a few but trust that there are certain ways I will never eat an avocado.<br> They are filled with potassium, magnesium, fiber and healthy monounsaturated fats, and they also contain certain compounds called carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to the reduction of cancer risks. In addition, certain compounds in avocados may reduce inflammation in young skin cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In one study, people were asked to consume a slice of avocado with a hamburger. After a period of time, it was discovered that they had lower levels of the inflammatory markers than participants who ate just the hamburger.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg" alt="Green tea" class="wp-image-579" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/green-tea-1-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Green tea</strong> Everybody drinks one green tea or another these days.I don&#8217;t blame them,It has immense benefits. You&#8217;ve probably heard that green tea is one of the healthiest drinks you can take. It is known to reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, obesity and other inflammatory problems. Many of its benefits are due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances it contains, especially a substance known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).EGCG reduces inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. It also prevents damage to the fatty acids in your cells. Varieties of green teas can be found in stores all around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg" alt="Peppers" class="wp-image-580" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Peppers-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Peppers</strong> don&#8217;t exactly feel or taste pleasant. Despite the flavour they add to certain meals, they are known for a signature burn, some more than others. They have anti-inflammatory properties and that make them an essential in our diet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bell peppers and chili peppers are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants that inhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Bell peppers contain the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce at least one marker of oxidative damage in people with an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis. Chili peppers contain compounds like sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which can reduce inflammation and lead to more life expectancy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg" alt="Mushrooms" class="wp-image-581" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mushrooms-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Mushrooms </strong>are those adorable little umbrella plants that are believed to house pixies and while hundreds of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible. Others are poisonous.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trick to being able to differentiate between good mushrooms and bad mushrooms lies somewhere on Google. You should find it. To save you the trouble, the good mushrooms include truffles,portobello mushrooms, and shiitake.<br> Mushrooms are considered to be very low in calories but rich in selenium, copper and the entire B vitamin family. They are also packed with phenols and other antioxidants that provide antiinflammatory aid. A special kind of mushroom called lion&#8217;s mane may potentially reduce the low-grade inflammation seen in obese individuals. Also, one study found that cooking mushrooms lowered their anti-inflammatory compounds so it may be best to eat them raw.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg" alt="Grape" class="wp-image-582" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grape-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Grape </strong>Round, beautiful, tasty and apparently, anti-inflammatory.Grapes contain substances like anthocyanins which reduce inflammation. Also, they can decrease the risk of several diseases,including heart problems, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and some eye disorders.<br> Grapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol, another substance known for its many health benefits. In one study, people with heart problems consumed grape extract daily and experienced a significant decrease in inflammatory gene markers. Another interesting fact is that their levels of adiponectin increased. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg" alt="Turmeric " class="wp-image-583" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmeric-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Turmeric </strong>is a yellow or orange spice with a strong,earthy flavor that is often used in curries and other Indian dishes. It has received a lot of attention for its content of the powerful antiinflammatory substance called curcumin. Turmeric is proven to be effective at reducing the inflammation related to hepatitis, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Turmeric is THE superfood of superfoods!<br> A study showed that one gram of curcumin everyday mixed with piperine from black pepper caused a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP in people with metabolic syndrome. The problem however is that it may be hard to get enough curcumin to have a noticeable effect from just turmeric. It needs to be combined with other substances to get the full experience. In one study, obese women who took 2.8 grams of turmeric everyday had no improvement whatsoever in inflammatory markers.<br> If you can&#8217;t seem to find anything to combine turmeric with, taking supplements containing isolated curcumin is also effective.<br> Curcumin supplements are usually combined with piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by a lot! Turmeric is also used as a face mask for skin inflammation, but it is not as effective on its own as it will be when mixed with other things like milk, lemon, honey, oatmeal, and so on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1.jpg" alt="Extra virgin olive oil" class="wp-image-584" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extra-virgin-olive-oil-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong>, is one of the healthiest kinds of fat you can eat. It is rich in monounsaturated fats and an essential in the Mediterranean diet, which provides immense health benefits. Research links extra virgin olive oil to a significantly reduced risk of heart disease, brain cancer and other major health conditions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lovely green goodness<br> In one Mediterranean diet study, some inflammatory markers significantly decreased in those who consumed 50 ml of olive oil daily. The effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, can been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or diclofenac. Don&#8217;t forget that anti-inflammatory benefits are much greater in extra virgin olive oil than in more refined olive oils. It&#8217;s very easy to find extra virgin olive oil in your neighbourhood grocery store, but you can also buy it online.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg" alt="Dark chocolate" class="wp-image-585" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dark-chocolate-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> ● <strong>Dark chocolate</strong> Chocolate as an anti-inflammatory food? Oh yeah! Dark chocolate is absolutely delicious, rich, satisfying and a way for life for some good folks like myself. It is also loaded with antioxidants that reduce inflammation. Dark chocolate can actually reduce your risk of inflammation and heart disease.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Dark chocolate! My precioussssss.<br>
Flavanols &#8211; the anti-inflammatory substance in dark chocolate &#8211; are responsible for chocolate&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effects and keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy. In one clinical study, smokers experienced significant improvement in endothelial function few hours after eating chocolate that&#8217;s high in flavonol. Make sure to always choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa -more is always better &#8211; in order to get the anti-inflammatory benefits.<br>
You can buy that chocolate bar now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg" alt="Tomatoes " class="wp-image-586" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tomatoes-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Tomatoes </strong>The tomato is another superfood. It is high in nutrients and has many healing properties include fixing sunburns!<br> Tomatoes are very high in vitamin C, potassium and lycopene, the antioxidant with impressive anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is also particularly beneficial for reducing pro-inflammatory compounds related to several kinds of cancer.<br> Clinical studies have determined that drinking tomato juice significantly decreased inflammatory markers in overweight women.<br> It doesn&#8217;t work as much in obese women though.Cooking tomatoes in olive oil can maximize the amount of lycopene available for absorption. What did you expect from the combination of two very powerful anti inflammatory foods? Tomatoes can be eaten raw or cooked. They&#8217;re a key component of pasta sauce, vegetable salad,sandwiches and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg" alt="Cinnamon " class="wp-image-587" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cinnamon-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Cinnamon </strong>is a very delicious spice with a distinctive smell. It contains a compound called cinnamaldehyde which is responsible for inhibiting certain proteins such as actin and C-reactive protein, which can lead to inflammation.<br> Cinnamaldehyde also works by stopping unwanted agglutination of blood platelets that can lead to inflammation by sending signals for the release of arachidonic acid and reducing the formation of thromboxane A2. Too much cinnamon may cause breathing difficulties so take it in moderation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1768" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger.jpg 750w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ginger-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">● <strong>Ginger </strong>Apart from being a delicious addition to a wide range of meals, ginger is stacked with a lot of health benefits beyond inflammation. It is known to improve metabolism and help fight oxidative damage. Studies have shown that the compounds gingerol and zingerone found in ginger are solely responsible for the root&#8217;s ability to fight inflammation. They have been linked to reductions in many forms of inflammation, from colitis to kidney damage to diabetes and hepatitis.<br> The absolute best way to consume ginger is to eat the raw root.Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. Although it may be difficult for your body to break down the fiber, it is the best way to get all the anti-inflammatory substances absorbed into your body. However, for the faint of heart, it is also available in powder and supplement form.</p>
