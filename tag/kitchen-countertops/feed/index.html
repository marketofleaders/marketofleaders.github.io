<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchen-To-Share.jpg" alt="kitchen To Share" class="wp-image-1086"/></figure></div>



<p> Living together with colleagues in the apartment can leave you with some hobbies such as not being able to stand the silence of an empty place, but also valuable teachings. You have to be very supportive of the customs, manners, and laziness of people.</p>



<p> If you are about to share your kitchen, you should try to make peace between you and your roommates. Therefore, not only will you have to maintain that relationship with them, but you will also need to take care of and maintain your minimalist style. In this chapter, you will find tips on how to make that possible.</p>



<h3>Tip #1: Divide the refrigerator and you will win</h3>



<p> When different people live in a house, the tastes are different. Maybe the refrigerator is always full of beers, or other things that perhaps you don’t really like. In case there is only one refrigerator, the best thing you can do is that each person has their own shelf. Also, it is better not to make everyone buy stuffs the same day. Doing so, the refrigerator and the pantry get stuck. You have to coordinate the days of purchase of each one.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Place your food in the fridge strategically</h3>



<p> The food that you leave near the refrigerator door is the one that finishes first. It is better to put it behind, but be careful that it will not be forgotten or it will be spoiled.</p>



<h3>Tip #3: Reach an agreement to consume only one type of milk</h3>



<p> Unless one is lactose intolerant, another vegan and one more prefers chocolate. It is better to have only one type of milk for everyone. Products like salt, sugar, and oil also work and less mess is made.</p>



<h3>Tip #4: Do not be afraid to throw out the outdated, even if it&#8217;s alien</h3>



<p> If you see a yogurt that is going to expire, it is best that you eat it, notify the owner and replenish it. If you detect that something has already broken down, throw it away. You do not even have to notice it; they forgot it for a reason.</p>



<h3>Tip #5: Wash that dirty rate from days ago; it does not matter if it&#8217;s from another</h3>



<p> Unwashed dishes create a mess and can be an important point of conflict. It is better everyone washes his dishes and there is no major problem. If you find something small like a glass or a spoon, nothing happens if you wash it. But if a person tends to leave what he uses without washing, it is best to talk to him about that.</p>



<h3>Tip #6: Hire a cleaning professional and divide the rate</h3>



<p> Using these services once or twice a week is the best and the payment is divided among all. In truth that makes things much simpler.</p>



<h3>Tip #7: Take turns to take out the organic trash</h3>



<p> There are many people who do not know how to separate trash and it is very important to have this skill. The best thing is to take the trash religiously on Saturday or another day. And, you have to make turns because nobody wants to take care of the organic trash. This is because it smells the worst and drips.</p>



<h4>How To Move Your Kitchen In The Fastest And Most Save Way?</h4>



<p> If you live in a rental and you are young, then changes are usually part of your life: moving to new countries, new jobs, and therefore, new floors are treaded on every day. So this is surely neither the first nor the last time.</p>



<p> Therefore, you can develop techniques or strategies to make this process less tedious, much more practical, quick and organized and make sure that you only take the essentials home to your kitchen.</p>



<h4>What Comes Before The Move?</h4>



<p> As you know a long time ago that you are going to move to your new apartment, you can begin a strong and complete declutter process.<br> It takes a couple of days trying to plan where your things will be located in<br> the new apartment. This is useful for two reasons.</p>



<ol><li>The first is that it allows you to plan now the flow of the move (what to take first and what to take later).</li><li>The second is that it helps you to practice the famous minimalist question: do I have a space to store it? If there is no space for something, then that something should not reach the new apartment.</li></ol>



<h4>Techniques For Moving Faster And Safer Way</h4>



<p> <strong>Technique #1: Make a list of your future needs</strong><br> Think about the needs that you will have in your new home: do you go to a smaller or larger house? In the city or in a town? Do you have exit to the outside or terrace? Is the weather warmer or cooler? Wet or dry? All this will help you to understand what kind of things you will need to take with you and which ones definitely should be left behind. Despite being a minimalist style, a kitchen consists of a number of different individual modules, countertops, accessories, and equipment.</p>



<p> For example, is the furniture in your old kitchen kept in good condition?<br> Calculate the costs of dismantling, transport, accessories (in most cases you have to change the countertops), assembly and possible installation work and wiring. In short, value the costs and risks of maintaining your old kitchen.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #2: Prepare this area in three parts: recycling, reuse and moving</strong><br> Especially clear this area to deposit objects that you neither need nor use for anything (recycling), those that you do not need but still have utility (reuse) and those that you need and you will take to your next home (move).</p>



<p><strong> Technique #3: Divide your objects by categories</strong><br> If you start to select objects without a specific order you will get tired and discouraged very quickly. To make this process more organized you can use a checklist (mentioned in technique #1).</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #4: Begin to select</strong><br> Select the items in the first category of the checklist in each of the three parts of the kitchen area (recycling, reuse, and removal). Then go to the next category, and the next, and the next to finish with the checklist. This is the first filter for a kitchen only with what is necessary and what you most want, so do not be sorry. Allow only items with these characteristics into your life and everything will be to your advantage: a minimalist kitchen from the beginning, less weight to carry and move, more space and order, etc.</p>



<p> We recommend making a list of pending and schedule pre-move tasks:</p>



<ul><li> Sort belongings</li><li> Organize what you will take.</li><li> Take recycling to the collection center.</li><li> Save what you are going to keep.</li><li> What should be left before the day of moving.</li><li> What to do on the day of the move</li></ul>



<p><strong>Technique #5: Recycle</strong><br> Gather all the objects in the recycling area and remember the infallible trick for your minimalist cleaning. Recycle your discarded belongings as soon as possible.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #6: Reuse</strong><br> Donate, give away or resell everything that is in good condition and may be needed by others. If you think there is something that can be useful to the next tenant (open cleaning products, brooms or mops, kitchen utensils), give it to him and write him a note so he knows he can use them.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #7: Start packing</strong><br> Pack by categories leaving out only what is necessary for the last days. Do not buy new boxes to keep. Sure, what you have at home already serves you (suitcases, large reusable shopping bags, plastic storage boxes, baskets, etc.).<br> Finally, do not forget to label the boxes so you will know where you have everything and it will be easier to find a specific item when you arrive at your new home.</p>



<p><strong>Technique #8: Organize in boxes what you are going to keep</strong><br> Prepare to save what you will keep and separate in boxes by priorities:</p>



<ul><li> <strong>High</strong>: What is very necessary and functional</li><li> <strong>Media</strong>: What you would like to unpack soon but which is not necessary.</li><li> <strong>Low</strong>: What is decorative</li></ul>



<p>This will allow you to unpack more peacefully and without haste.</p>



<p> <strong>Advice: Systematize the move</strong></p>



<ul><li> To make everything easier, differentiate the boxes.</li><li> Write down the space they belong to.</li><li> Assign a number by priority (1 is the highest priority).</li></ul>



<p> This way, once you arrive at your new home, you can take the boxes to their respective spaces and open only those that has the number 1 marked. Little by little you can open the others.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #9: And the day arrives! Organize your move</strong><br> If you have a moving service, congratulations! And if not, you have to load.<br> If you have an elevator, congratulations again! And if not, you have to load up the stairs (if any). To make everything more bearable, ask for help from friends and family and reward them with a good meal (after all who wouldn’t settle for a good meal?). In addition, this will help you to establish an organization system: first the largest furniture, then the small ones together with boxes and suitcases, and finally small objects to fill in the gaps.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #10: When everything is ready to go, clean</strong><br> When the van is full and the house empty, take advantage and do a good general cleaning. Nobody likes to find a dirty house, and although it sounds a bit weird. It will be good for you to spend some time alone with the house, say goodbye and think about this new stage in which you are embarking.</p>



<p> <strong>Technique #11: When you get to your new home, do not unpack anything</strong><br> Yes, we know that this is the opposite of what is always said: it is important to unpack and place as soon as possible to get rid of it and continue with our lives. But, maybe not. Unpack little by little only what you need and miss and leave the rest untouched for up to a month. What you did not get out after that time, you probably do not need it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. As we saw in the previous chapter, the maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Minimalist style is ideal for you if you have a tendency to get rid of things that seem to not fit easily. The maxim that best sums up the cornerstone of this trend is that less is more. i.e., what is essential is to have few things but each one performs its function perfectly.</p>



<p> For this reason, we will see a unique kitchen set up ideas to design your minimalist kitchen to create space.</p>



<h4>Idea #1: Everything in its place</h4>



<p> In the minimalist style, each item occupies a certain position that is defined by its functionality. In a style that less is more, simplicity is the key to its appeal.</p>



<h4>Idea #2: Attention to details</h4>



<p> The minimalist aesthetic can be present in any detail and if not, look at this spectacular staircase in the image below. Its simplicity, lighting, and design leaves no space for doubt. It is a perfect minimalist example.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/staircase.jpg" alt="staircase" class="wp-image-1077"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #3: Kitchen modern minimalist vintage</h4>



<p> For most modern interior or minimalist you can decant lacquered furniture that has a glossy or Matt finish. You can combine this color with accessories in aluminum or steel finishes, resulting to a modern outlook.</p>



<p> The walls can also be plain white, because you may have a smooth or tile wall. On the ceiling is also white is a good choice although it should be avoided in the floor. For these, it is best to use white but with touches of gray or sand colors.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-modern-minimalist-vintage.jpg" alt="Kitchen modern minimalist vintage" class="wp-image-1078"/></figure></div>



<h4>Idea #4: Ingenious solution</h4>



<p> When it comes to minimizing the presence of furniture and various appliances, relying on multifunctional elements can be a perfect solution. A piece of furniture acts as a bookstore, support for the television and improvised dividing wall of the entrance. What more could you want?</p>



<h4>Idea #5: Set of contrasts</h4>



<p> Not everything in minimalism should be clear white. Although the background color is important, you can combine it with grey or black resulting in spaces full of pure class and elegance.</p>



<h4>Idea #6: Kitchen in L</h4>



<p> Regardless of the actual size of your kitchen, if you adopt a minimalist style, this will help you to manage that space and make it look even broader. If you also like L design, you will earn meters for the circulation within it.</p>



<h4>Idea #7: materials</h4>



<p> Far from what it may seem, the minimalist style has nothing of aseptic or cold. Indeed, the interiors that are committed to this trend often introduce materials that provide warmth, such as the wood.</p>



<h4>Idea #8: Functional kitchen</h4>



<p> The details are great allies of the minimalist style. Why? The answer is simple. It’s a trend of little prone to recharging spaces, the existence of nuances is essential to create spaces full of qualities. In this case, incorporate one of these details as a counter, a practical bar for a functional space and style.</p>



<h4>Idea #9: Colonize the walls</h4>



<p> An alternative to the incorporation of the furnishings is that you can take advantage of the possibilities offered by the walls of your home. Place shelves do not have reasons to be overloaded. This allows you to embrace the minimalist style.</p>



<p>Idea #10: High ceilings</p>



<p> The high ceilings and loft-style homes are ideal for decorating with minimalist style scenarios. The amplitude at the height of this type of construction is a delight in creating unique spaces that is beautiful to behold.</p>



<h4>Idea #11: Save space in the Hall</h4>



<p> Often we tend to waste Hall space but it is a very valuable and useful meters. You can use the space for a series of cabinets which, though unnoticed, will give you great service.</p>



<h4>Idea #12: Mileage counters</h4>



<p> Counters are increasingly becoming quite common in kitchen designs. Not only in minimal spaces but also in any style. These type of elements are particularly useful not only in functionality but also for its marked aesthetic component.</p>



<h4>Idea #13: All-in-one</h4>



<p> Even if you don&#8217;t have space problems, minimalism is a style ideal to solve the home décor. This kitchen does not sacrifice a single centimeter by incorporating the necessary furniture, simplicity is the key to its appeal. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kitchen-All-in-one.jpg" alt="Kitchen All-in-one" class="wp-image-1079"/></figure></div>



<p> Anyway, remember that any space in your home is susceptible to succumb to the minimalist style and kitchen full of charm. All you have to do is just to visualize and decorate! </p>



<h2><strong>Now, How Should Your Minimalist Kitchen Be?</strong></h2>



<p> In the kitchen, it is common to accumulate accessories and decorations, some more useful than others. However, through minimalism, the tendency now is to achieve functional and sober kitchen environment that gives the sensation of order and harmony. Below, we are going to outline some characteristics that you can consider for your minimalist kitchen.</p>



<h4>Feature #1: Utility and practicality</h4>



<p> One of the first characteristics of a minimalist kitchen is the functionality. All kitchens must have an area of work where to cut, chop, whip and clean to make the task more efficient. This is why keeping a clear countertop is the first step to follow.</p>



<h4>Feature #2: Covered and stored appliances</h4>



<p> Some appliances that are not used on a daily basis such as grinder or Blender must be stored inside a cupboard so they are not in sight. The same goes with utensils and cutlery, which must be saved, but in an accessible place, for practical use of them when it comes to cooking and eating.</p>



<h4>Feature #3: Housekeeping</h4>



<p> Cleaning after every meal is essential for the provision of a neat and harmonious appearance. This detail will not only allow you to have a more minimalist space but also present you and your family comfort in your home.</p>



<h4>Feature #4: uncluttered space (for small spaces)</h4>



<p> To get the feeling of harmony and order it is important to have uncluttered spaces, no objects in the middle, especially if you do not have a large space. In addition, you must opt for simple geometries of straight lines in countertops, Islands, and cupboards.</p>



<h4>Feature #5: The colors of minimalism</h4>



<p> White is the color par excellence of the minimalism that gives an excellent result. In chairs, high or worktops of granite you can look for contrast and create harmony in the space. For example, you can combine white with grey and black. Also, the white floor and utensils in this tone, are the best choice to give light and beautiful ambience to the room.</p>



<p> Avoid colors like yellow, Orange and Brown.</p>



<h4>Feature #6: The cupboard</h4>



<p> The cupboards should be large and of practical design to keep all the utensils and cutlery neatly in place. It is common to finish with a shiny lacquer and straight lines on the doors, without any adornment and in neutral tones, mainly white.</p>



<h4>Feature #7: Appliances and furniture</h4>



<p> For the sink, the oven and the refrigerator, stainless steel is the best option, and the ceramic hob can be black on a white countertop.</p>



<p> The islands are a constant of this style with white chairs without backrest or with a black metal backrest to contrast.</p>



<h2>Some Tricks For Your Minimalist Kitchen</h2>



<h4>Trick #1: Kitchen islands</h4>



<p> If we talk about things that are fashionable for kitchens, you must have that clear: the Islands. We cannot define exactly the key to its success. But, the truth is that people who test it often become unrepentant.</p>



<ul><li> Islands better distribute the space in the kitchen.</li><li> They serve as a separator between the kitchen and dining room.</li><li> They allow you to move through them in one way more simple.</li><li> The Islands can be defined spaces, superior, where the countertop provides you a great area of work, and the bottom, perfect storage space to store dishes and other kitchen utensils.</li></ul>



<h4>Trick # 2: The order</h4>



<p> If there is something that attracts people to minimalism, it is precisely the sense of order that it gives to the kitchen. In the minimalist kitchen, there should be an almost total absence of accessories and furniture without handles.</p>



<h4>Trick # 3: Lighting</h4>



<p> The lights integrated into the furniture are a great success and if you decide to put them in your kitchen you will surely love the result. It facilitates the search for kitchen tools and also illuminates the rest of the room with charm and elegance.</p>



<p> With regard to lighting, it is very important in minimalist kitchens. A good combination of colors favor the lighting of the space. Strengthen the entrance of external light and think well about the distribution of the furniture so that they do not hinder its entrance. The cupboards with transparent doors for the tableware are perfect the most of spaces. Lighting should be white and modern light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg" alt="kitchen-cleaning" class="wp-image-855" data-layzr-srcset="https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1.jpg 640w, https://mealinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/house-cleaning-1-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<p> If you have a toddler and you think your kitchen is clean, all you need to do is turn around a few times, and your baby has probably found a way to find a new distraction causing another messy cleanup.</p>



<p> Let’s take a look at the kitchen cleaning methods and clean from the countertops to the kitchen floor.</p>



<h2> The Kitchen Sink:</h2>



<p> It’s time to tackle the kitchen sink. Just because you wash out the sink daily after you do a load of dishes, doesn’t mean it is clean. Water spots, rust, soap scum, and food stains can build up if you don’t stay ahead of them.</p>



<p> <strong>Porcelain Sinks:</strong> If you have a porcelain sink, you can make it gleam with this process:</p>



<ul><li>Line the sink with paper towels.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Soak them with bleach.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Let them soak for 30 minutes, and discard them.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Rinse the sink with hot running water.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Note</strong>: Don’t use bleach on colored porcelain because it will fade. Instead, use vinegar, baking soda, or a mild detergent (and a bit of elbow grease).</p>



<p> Now that you have the sink clean, you can protect it from scratches and stains by installing a plastic mat on the bottom of the sink. The mat will protect the shiny sink from lingering acidic foods/liquids such as salad dressing, vinegar, and fruit.</p>



<p><strong> The Garbage Disposal</strong>: If you smell something that seems rancid, it could be the garbage disposal needs some cleaning also. Simply, grind a few lemons in the unit to make it fresh and clean. Repeat the process every few weeks. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the drain for several hours before running the disposal. For a deeper clean, use this method for the garbage disposal drain:<br> What You Need:</p>



<p> ● White Vinegar (1 Cup)<br> ● Baking Soda (.5 cup)<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>The mixture will fizz (remember pop rocks candy from the 1970s) with a popping noise.</li><li>Wait a few minutes.</li><li>Pour boiling water down the drain.</li><li>Fill the drain with 2 cups of ice.</li><li>Pour one cup of salt in the drain over the ice cubes (rock salt or sea salt is a good choice if you have it).</li><li>Turn the cold-water faucet to the on position.</li><li>Turn on the disposal unit.</li><li>Run the disposal until the ice is gone.</li><li>The grime and debris should be loosened. Cut a lime or lemon in half and let the disposal chew them up for a deodorized drain.</li></ul>



<h2> Sanitizing the Sponges</h2>



<p> You can sanitize your sponge by tossing it into the microwave for ten to twenty seconds. It will kill all of the bacterial germs hiding in the nooks and crannies! Let them air dry thoroughly. Make an attempt to replace them every two weeks.</p>



<h2> Clean Small Appliances</h2>



<p> ● <strong>Toasters</strong>: Remove the crumbs from the toaster and toaster oven. Clean the racks with hot, soapy water to remove any food debris.<br> ● <strong>Can Opener</strong>: Take the opener apart and clean the cutter by soaking it in hot, soapy water. Scrub the blade with a scouring pad if necessary. Be careful, so you don’t get cut on the sharp blade.<br> ● <strong>The Blender</strong>: If you have ever tried to clean a blender, you know how involved the process can become. Simply add some soapy water in the blender, blend, rinse, and dry — no more hands on the sharp blades, or first aid kits necessary for the job.<br> ● Wipe all surfaces of the other small appliances.</p>



<h2>Clean the Microwave</h2>



<p> Remove any trays and wash them in hot, soapy water. Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe and scrub the entire unit. Be sure to spray the cleaner on the rag or sponge; not directly in the microwave.</p>



<p> You can also go the natural route with a few sliced lemons and a bowl of water in the microwave. Turn the unit on high until the microwave is steamy.<br> Let it steep for a few minutes to cut through the grease and grime. You can easily wipe out the moisture, and replace it with a fresh smelling space.</p>



<h2> Clean the Refrigerator</h2>



<p> Begin at the top of the refrigerator and remove everything. Clean out each shelf as you proceed. If any of the drawers or shelves are removable, take each unit out, and use warm soapy water to clean it. You want to clean every surface, especially the ones on the door—inside and out.</p>



<p> Before placing your food back inside of the fridge, line the shelves with some parchment paper or plastic food wrap to make cleaning a breeze. If you have a small mess, just remove the layer of plastic, and it is clean!</p>



<h2> Super-Clean the Oven</h2>



<p> Use natural products to clean the oven manually. You can choose from several techniques for general cleaning of your oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 1:</strong> Simply apply a layer of baking soda and spray it with a vinegar solution. It should form a paste. Leave the mixture on the surface of the oven for five minutes. Wipe the oven with a damp rag or sponge.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 2:</strong> First, take a look at one of the general natural cleaning options using baking soda:<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda<br> ● Water<br> ● Spray bottle<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Begin by spraying the oven with water, so it’s damp.</li><li>Sprinkle a ¼-inch layer of the soda, making sure you cover the entire surface.</li><li>If you see a dry spot, respray it with the water.</li><li>Let the mixture rest for at least three to four hours with the oven OFF.</li><li>Wipe the paste with an old towel to remove the grime.</li><li>It could take several applications, but thank goodness, it is natural.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 3:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, this will help remove the stuck-on grease and food.<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda (3 tbsp.)<br> ● Warm water (1 cup)<br> ● Castile soap (1 tbsp.)<br> Variations:<br> ● Lemon &amp; Clove: Add 5 drops each.<br> ● Lemon: Add 10 drops essential oil<br> ● Lemon &amp; Rosemary: Add 5 drops of each oil.<br> How to Clean:</p>
