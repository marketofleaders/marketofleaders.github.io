<p> This is one major area that will have a profound impact on how your kitchen looks. Failure to use the storage area appropriately can ruin the good look of your kitchen. Your kitchen might appear spacious, but if things are not stored in their right places you might feel suffocated.</p>



<p> There are numerous storage ideas that you can utilize to give your kitchen a simplified yet comprehensive look. Some of these hacks are succinctly discussed in the following lines.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-layzr="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kitchen-Zones.jpg" alt="Kitchen-Zones" class="wp-image-1268" data-layzr-srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kitchen-Zones.jpg 750w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kitchen-Zones-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>Image Source:  quepolandia.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p> <strong>Pull-Out Pantries</strong><br> If you’ve been to a kitchen with pull-out pantries, then you know these storage spaces are indeed worth having in any modern kitchen. The exciting aspect of this storage space is that when you pull out the pantry drawer, you will gain access to multiple shelves. This means that you have more space within a single unit. The idea can be incorporated into your cabinets.</p>



<p> <strong>Pull-Out Spice Racks</strong><br> The pull-out spice racks as similar to pull-out pantries. Their designs are different since they are meant to hold boxes and jars.</p>



<p> <strong>Shelves Next to Your Kitchen Windows</strong><br> There is a great frame effect that you get when you incorporate floating shelves into your kitchen. Contingent on your window size, you can design varying sizes of your storage components. These shelves should be used as storage spaces for dishes and other cookware that you use frequently.</p>



<p><strong> Mug Racks</strong><br> There is something interesting about the mugs and cups we use for breakfast.<br> Most people have a personal attachment to their cups or mugs. It is for this reason that you will find folks using the same cup throughout the year. You should embrace the idea of hanging your favorite mugs and cups on hooks. A key issue to remember is that you should not make your kitchen crowded with these hangings. As such, limit the number of cups that you choose to hang.</p>



<p> <strong>Woven Storage Baskets</strong><br> There are certain spaces in your kitchen that will be unoccupied most of the time. They are called the kitchen islands. This space can be occupied by woven storage baskets. Doing this will help you create additional space that can hold items that don’t belong to the kitchen, such as your car keys or your smartphone.</p>



<p> There are many ways of creatively creating storage space around your kitchen. Your chosen technique should help in creating space and not crowding up the place. Therefore, you should settle for the best solutions which suit you.</p>



<p> Essentially, the importance of understanding the kitchen zones is that it aids in knowing what goes where in your kitchen. You cannot maintain an organized kitchen if you don’t know how its layout looks like. Also, this information is handy when one is looking to remodel their kitchen.</p>
