<p> If you have a toddler and you think your kitchen is clean, all you need to do is turn around a few times, and your baby has probably found a way to find a new distraction causing another messy cleanup.</p>



<p> Let’s take a look at the kitchen cleaning methods and clean from the countertops to the kitchen floor.</p>



<h2> The Kitchen Sink:</h2>



<p> It’s time to tackle the kitchen sink. Just because you wash out the sink daily after you do a load of dishes, doesn’t mean it is clean. Water spots, rust, soap scum, and food stains can build up if you don’t stay ahead of them.</p>



<p> <strong>Porcelain Sinks:</strong> If you have a porcelain sink, you can make it gleam with this process:</p>



<ul><li>Line the sink with paper towels.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Soak them with bleach.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Let them soak for 30 minutes, and discard them.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Rinse the sink with hot running water.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Note</strong>: Don’t use bleach on colored porcelain because it will fade. Instead, use vinegar, baking soda, or a mild detergent (and a bit of elbow grease).</p>



<p> Now that you have the sink clean, you can protect it from scratches and stains by installing a plastic mat on the bottom of the sink. The mat will protect the shiny sink from lingering acidic foods/liquids such as salad dressing, vinegar, and fruit.</p>



<p><strong> The Garbage Disposal</strong>: If you smell something that seems rancid, it could be the garbage disposal needs some cleaning also. Simply, grind a few lemons in the unit to make it fresh and clean. Repeat the process every few weeks. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the drain for several hours before running the disposal. For a deeper clean, use this method for the garbage disposal drain:<br> What You Need:</p>



<p> ● White Vinegar (1 Cup)<br> ● Baking Soda (.5 cup)<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>The mixture will fizz (remember pop rocks candy from the 1970s) with a popping noise.</li><li>Wait a few minutes.</li><li>Pour boiling water down the drain.</li><li>Fill the drain with 2 cups of ice.</li><li>Pour one cup of salt in the drain over the ice cubes (rock salt or sea salt is a good choice if you have it).</li><li>Turn the cold-water faucet to the on position.</li><li>Turn on the disposal unit.</li><li>Run the disposal until the ice is gone.</li><li>The grime and debris should be loosened. Cut a lime or lemon in half and let the disposal chew them up for a deodorized drain.</li></ul>



<h2> Sanitizing the Sponges</h2>



<p> You can sanitize your sponge by tossing it into the microwave for ten to twenty seconds. It will kill all of the bacterial germs hiding in the nooks and crannies! Let them air dry thoroughly. Make an attempt to replace them every two weeks.</p>



<h2> Clean Small Appliances</h2>



<p> ● <strong>Toasters</strong>: Remove the crumbs from the toaster and toaster oven. Clean the racks with hot, soapy water to remove any food debris.<br> ● <strong>Can Opener</strong>: Take the opener apart and clean the cutter by soaking it in hot, soapy water. Scrub the blade with a scouring pad if necessary. Be careful, so you don’t get cut on the sharp blade.<br> ● <strong>The Blender</strong>: If you have ever tried to clean a blender, you know how involved the process can become. Simply add some soapy water in the blender, blend, rinse, and dry — no more hands on the sharp blades, or first aid kits necessary for the job.<br> ● Wipe all surfaces of the other small appliances.</p>



<h2>Clean the Microwave</h2>



<p> Remove any trays and wash them in hot, soapy water. Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe and scrub the entire unit. Be sure to spray the cleaner on the rag or sponge; not directly in the microwave.</p>



<p> You can also go the natural route with a few sliced lemons and a bowl of water in the microwave. Turn the unit on high until the microwave is steamy.<br> Let it steep for a few minutes to cut through the grease and grime. You can easily wipe out the moisture, and replace it with a fresh smelling space.</p>



<h2> Clean the Refrigerator</h2>



<p> Begin at the top of the refrigerator and remove everything. Clean out each shelf as you proceed. If any of the drawers or shelves are removable, take each unit out, and use warm soapy water to clean it. You want to clean every surface, especially the ones on the door—inside and out.</p>



<p> Before placing your food back inside of the fridge, line the shelves with some parchment paper or plastic food wrap to make cleaning a breeze. If you have a small mess, just remove the layer of plastic, and it is clean!</p>



<h2> Super-Clean the Oven</h2>



<p> Use natural products to clean the oven manually. You can choose from several techniques for general cleaning of your oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 1:</strong> Simply apply a layer of baking soda and spray it with a vinegar solution. It should form a paste. Leave the mixture on the surface of the oven for five minutes. Wipe the oven with a damp rag or sponge.</p>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 2:</strong> First, take a look at one of the general natural cleaning options using baking soda:<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda<br> ● Water<br> ● Spray bottle<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Begin by spraying the oven with water, so it’s damp.</li><li>Sprinkle a ¼-inch layer of the soda, making sure you cover the entire surface.</li><li>If you see a dry spot, respray it with the water.</li><li>Let the mixture rest for at least three to four hours with the oven OFF.</li><li>Wipe the paste with an old towel to remove the grime.</li><li>It could take several applications, but thank goodness, it is natural.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Natural Oven Cleaner: Option 3:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, this will help remove the stuck-on grease and food.<br> What You Need:<br> ● Baking soda (3 tbsp.)<br> ● Warm water (1 cup)<br> ● Castile soap (1 tbsp.)<br> Variations:<br> ● Lemon &amp; Clove: Add 5 drops each.<br> ● Lemon: Add 10 drops essential oil<br> ● Lemon &amp; Rosemary: Add 5 drops of each oil.<br> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Add all of the ingredients into a spray bottle. Shake well to mix.</li><li>To Use: Spray the oven liberally and let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li><li>Wipe it clean with a cloth or sponge. Rinse and let it air dry.</li><li>To Store: Store the leftovers for up to two weeks. Shake to<br> combine before using.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Manual Cleaning Ovens:</strong> <strong>Not Kid-Friendly:</strong> For tougher stains, you can use a commercial oven cleaner. You can also use a ½ cup of household ammonia.<br> Place the ammonia in a shallow pottery/glass container in the cold oven overnight. The burned-on food and grease will become loosened from the ammonia fumes.</p>



<p> Note: Don’t turn on the oven while the ammonia is inside of the oven.</p>



<p> <strong>Self-Cleaning Ovens:</strong> You are fortunate if you have a self-cleaning oven, but it also makes a mess with the ash left behind &#8211; similar to cigarette ashes. Clean up is simply wiping the ashes off the surfaces. If you don’t want to spend the extra time (anywhere from one to three hours) with an oven pumped up to 880 degrees; there is another way to clean those pesky spills.</p>



<p> <strong>Steam Cleaning Method: </strong>Choose the steam cleaning cycle which takes about 30 minutes.</p>



<ul><li>All you need to do is place one cup of water on the bottom of a cool oven.</li><li>Close the door and click the Steam Clean Cycle.</li></ul>



<p> The door won’t automatically lock, and it doesn’t involve any harsh chemicals. You also clean the racks while still in the oven. Wipe up the moisture and food debris and you are done!</p>



<p> <strong>Additional Helpful Usage Oven Tips:</strong></p>



<p> ● Never use commercial oven cleaners or liners of any type in or around any part of your self-cleaning oven.<br> ● Don’t use aluminum foil to catch any spillage.<br> ● Depending on the model the racks and pans might need to be removed. (Stainless steel must be removed.)</p>



<h2>Countertops &amp; The Backsplash</h2>



<p> Remove everything from the counters and thoroughly wipe down all of the surfaces using an all-purpose cleaner. Don’t forget the backsplash; it needs a good scrubbing also.</p>



<p> <strong>Special Countertops</strong><br> If you have white countertops, a cleaner with bleach included or soft-scrub (see the recipe) can be used for stubborn stains. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions, so you don’t damage the surfaces. These are the basics for four common countertops:</p>



<p> <strong>Stone Countertops: (Slate, Limestone, &amp; Soapstone):</strong><br> What You Need:<br> ● Warm, soapy water<br> ● A mild bleach solution<br> ● Or a non-abrasive cleaner</p>



<p> Note: Be sure to test a spot before you use anything other than warm, soapy water.</p>



<p> Grease Buildups: Use a mixture of white vinegar and water or an allpurpose cleaner.</p>



<p> You can also use a small brush such as a toothbrush to clean around the edges of the counters. Never use an abrasive pad because it will scratch the surface.</p>



<p> <strong>Butcher-Block Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> What You Need:</p>



<ul><li>Warm, soapy water</li><li>A mild bleach solution</li><li>A non-abrasive kitchen cleaner</li></ul>



<p> How to Clean:</p>



<ul><li>Use a toothbrush along the edging to remove any debris.</li><li>If the surface feels tacky, use a baking soda and water paste.</li><li>Then, rinse thoroughly.</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Ceramic Tile Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> You can use soap and water to clean ceramic tiles, but you need to be sure to rinse them thoroughly because soap can leave a filmy residue behind. Add some vinegar to the water to alleviate this issue. Never use an abrasive pad or cleaner.</p>



<p> Note: Even though the tile doesn’t stain easily—the grout will—with bacterial buildup as a result. Use a mild bleach solution and a toothbrush to clean the grout.</p>



<p> <strong>Concrete Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Clean the surface with warm and soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly.<br> You can use a mild bleach solution, but never use a scouring pad or abrasive cleaner on the surfaces.</p>



<p> For stubborn stains, you may also use talc mixed with a mixture of bleach, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste to the stained area, and use a soft brush to scrub the stain gently. Rinse thoroughly.</p>



<p> <strong>Marble Countertops:</strong></p>



<p> Cleaning marble countertops is a bit different. It should be cleaned regularly with a soft, damp cloth (microfiber works well) to prevent streaks. Rinse it thoroughly to remove any residue. Wipe it dry because air drying can create water spots.</p>



<p> If acidic foods stain the surface such as wine, orange juice, or tomatoes; you may need to have the professionals clean the spot.</p>



<h2> The Cutting Board</h2>



<p> You have two choices to remove the leftover stains and smells on your cutting board using natural products. Use a lemon to scrub the board down.<br> You can also sprinkle some baking soda on the surface to remove some of the odors. Just rinse the board later and let it dry. You can also purchase plastic cutting boards that come in several colors for each type of food you would cut.</p>



<h2> Cabinets &#8211; Drawers &amp; Shelves</h2>



<p> Use a damp rag to clean any spills, spots, or splatters with an all-purpose cleaner. If you have wooden cabinets; use some Murphy’s Oil Soap, so the wood isn’t damaged. However, if the cabinets are new, it is best to ask the manufacturer or builder what works best on your particular cabinet.</p>



<p> <strong>Copper Pots</strong></p>



<p> Copper pots hanging in a kitchen makes it have a charming, homey effect.<br> Not only that, but it also saves a lot of space. However, you want to keep the surfaces shiny. Try one of these natural remedies that might surprise you:<br> ● <strong>Catsup</strong>: Give catsup a whirl; it will look really gross, but the acid will help cut through the tarnished surface.<br> ● <strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong>: Pour some AC vinegar into a paper plate and let it soak. Rinse the pan and dry it completely.<br> ● <strong>Lemons &amp; Salt</strong>: Cut the lemon into wedges; dip a wedge into the salt, and rub the pan until it’s clean. Rinse the pan quickly and thoroughly in cold water, and wipe it dry.<br> ● <strong>Beer</strong>: Put some beer on the pot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes. Rinse and wipe it until dry and shiny.<br> ● <strong>Cottage Cheese</strong>: This is a cure that works without any scrubbing. Leave a layer of cottage cheese on the bottom for approximately five minutes. Rinse it completely and dry.</p>



<p> <strong>Stained Coffee Mugs:</strong></p>
