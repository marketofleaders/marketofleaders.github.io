<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In a supercharged kitchen, true nourishment begins. There’s so much potential, wherever you live, to create memories of love and hospitality that will linger in the imagination of your family and friends. The kitchen is where your food culture is established, where you decide on and store the kinds of ingredients you wish to share with your loved ones. You can either have a pantry full of pre-packaged foods, or a wondrous landscape of individual, fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients waiting to be combined into fulfilling, wholesome meals.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Many people find the kitchen a stressful place to be; some even despise cooking, preferring to fork out money for a convenient takeaway meal. The problem with this is you’re not just paying for the food, you’re paying for a business. The way many restaurant and take away businesses make their money is by minimizing expenditure to increase their profit margin; in other words, they buy cheap, low-quality ingredients, make them taste good by coating them in additive-laden sauces and seasonings, then sell each dish at a price that allows their staff, rent and bills to be paid, with some extra on top for the business owners. I’d much rather put my money towards quality, ethically produced ingredients sourced from local producers and farmers’ markets, add a little kitchen work and enjoy a meal that’s better on my wallet, better for the planet, and better for my body and my family. You? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Food is at the heart of the home, and cooking is the vehicle to ensure a healthier and happier society. Michael Pollan famously addresses what he calls ‘a curious paradox’ around food in his book Cooked, where he observes that his fellow Americans seem to be devoting more time to thinking about food than ever before. An increasing interest in TV shows about food and cooking coincides with a collective disengagement from real food and the act of cooking in the home. With more meals prepared outside the home thanks to industrial food production, it seems the less Americans cook, the more interesting they find food and its preparation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> If we’re so transfixed by cooking that we spend hours gazing at, thinking about and observing it in the media, why as a society do we value our own kitchens so little? It’s time we began to fall in love with the instinctive, natural, utterly human behaviour of cooking once again, and we can only fall in love with our kitchens when we rekindle our love for food. Food is central to the seven keystones of life, as discussed earlier, and this is where we need to begin our food safari – in the heart of the home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> At this point in history, we seem busier than ever. We outsource everything, including our food preparation. The definition of ‘cooking’ for the modern man or woman appears to include taking out a packet of pre-made ravioli and pre-made pasta sauce, heating them up and covering them with pre-grated cheese. This is a far cry from the home preparation of stocks, breads and other foods that our great-grandparents would have been involved in daily.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Previous generations were raised knowing where their food came from. They probably visited or lived on the farms where their fruit and vegetables grew, maybe even picked them from their own backyard, preserving the excess bounty as jams and pickles to be eaten in the months that followed. Not yet dictated to by a global market, they would have eaten seasonally, knowing that winter is a time for grounding root vegetable stews, and that spring brings the sweetest green peas and juicy lamb chops. Sadly for 21st-century generations, we’ve completely lost touch with our earth’s seasonal wisdom and how it provides our body with exactly the nutrients and life forces it needs to flourish through the extremes.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take a fresh look at salads and you’ll see there are a lot of exciting developments in the salad bowl. Banished forever is the image of salads as dull diet food consisting of little more than limp lettuce and soggy, flavorless tomatoes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today, salads are one of the ultimate health foods. They can contain an exciting variety of colorful, delicious, and satisfying ingredients that provide the nutrients essential for healthy living. Remember, salads aren’t just for summer. We have plenty of ideas for salads that brighten and lighten winter mealtimes, too. In fact, once you get into the habit of thinking “salad” while menu planning, ideas will also come to you whatever the time of the year as you push your shopping cart along the supermarket aisles or stop at the cheese counter or produce department.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
are versatile enough to cater for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Meat,
seafood, and poultry are ideal salad ingredients, along with the perhaps more
commonly used lettuce and other leaves, vegetables, fruit, herbs, nuts, seeds,
grains, legumes, and cheese. And with so many ingredients to choose from,
salads can be as simple and light or complex and filling as you like. They also
have the added bonus that they are versatile enough to fit easily into all your
meal plans, from first courses through to desserts.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As
you flip through these recipes you’ll find classic favorites—Caesar salad,
chef’s salad, and salad niçoise, to name a few—as well as fresh, new ideas that
capture the flavors of cuisines around the world. If, for example, the idea of
chicken salad doesn’t excite because you’ve been making the same recipe out of
habit for as long as you can remember, try Thai-Style Chicken Salad. You’ll
never think of chicken salad as humdrum again!</p>



<h1>Bowls of Goodness</h1>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It
wasn’t long ago that when “salads” and “health” were linked it was in the
context of weight-reducing diets that were restrictive and ultimately
unsatisfying. Today, however, salads are a delicious component of a healthy
diet, giving you endless variety at mealtimes without long hours in the
kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">With
fresh produce from all corners of the globe readily available in supermarkets
and gourmet food stores, you can enjoy a variety of salads all year round but,
remember, salads are at their most flavorsome and nutritious when made with
seasonal produce in its prime.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We
are all being urged to eat more fruit and vegetables every day, and a salad a
day can go a long way to help you meet the minimum target of 2½ cups for
adults. Enjoy a bowl of Traditional Greek Salad or Three-Color Salad, for
example, and you’ll be more than halfway to success. What could be easier—or
more enjoyable?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Salads
also make great accompaniments, served alongside a filling bowl of pasta or a
plate of hot or cold roast meat.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green leaves with a simple oil-and-vinegar dressing, it’s definitely time to think again. And don’t make the mistake of thinking all salad ingredients have to be raw, either. Adding small amounts of cooked meat, poultry and seafood to lettuce leaves and other vegetables gives you a satisfying meal. If you want a meal-in-a-bowl, try Roast Pork with Pumpkin, Smoked Chicken Salad with Avocado &amp; Tarragon Dressing, and Shrimp &amp; Rice Salad, for example. There are plenty of vegetarian main-course salads, too, such as the Middle Eastern favorite Tabbouleh and Buckwheat Noodle Salad with Smoked Tofu.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cooked vegetables also make good salad ingredients. Grilled peppers, fried eggplants, blanched beans of all varieties, and peas are just some of the cooked vegetables.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">So,
if you regularly fall back on the old favorite of just tossing a few green

been greater. And don’t make the mistake of thinking all salad ingredients have
